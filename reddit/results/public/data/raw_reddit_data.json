There are plenty of advice for entrepreneurs, but I feel like most of it is just bullshit circulating. Everyone repeats the same things: \"Think big\", \"Hire the best\", \"Look for a blue ocean\", \"Develop your brand\", \"Make a product that users love and it‚Äôs enough\", and so on, without actually putting any meaning in these words.\n\n***There is no rule that is universally applicable, not even this one.***\n\nAnd despite being true, ‚ÄúHire the best‚Äù isn‚Äôt very useful until you have a strategy for doing it.\n\nI‚Äôve heard it thousands of times in different forms: \"Hire the best\", \"A‚Äôs hire A‚Äôs, B‚Äôs C‚Äôs, C's hire dogs\", \"If you hire the best people you will succeed even if you do everything else wrong\". I‚Äôm sure you can continue the list.\n\nBut the question is: \"**How?**\" How do you actually hire the best?\n\nTo release the app, I needed a native Spanish linguist to create content for the course.\n\nAfter 20 years in software development, having been interviewed at Amazon, FB, Google, and Microsoft, and conducting countless interviews myself, I knew that hiring is hard. But my task seemed simple and straightforward, and I didn‚Äôt expect any pitfalls. So I just followed my first instinct: \"Hey, Facebook friends, can you recommend a Spanish-native linguist?\" And I got a recommendation, of course.\n\nYou can‚Äôt underestimate the incompetence of a linguist found through Facebook. I won‚Äôt go into details, but it was a train wreck: a complete inability to write high-quality content, a failure to follow simple three-step logic, and constant schedule disruptions.\n\nAfter this failure, I knew that if I wanted to make an app for 20+ languages, I needed a more robust and predictable process.\n\n**The Right Process**\n\nMy logic was simple¬†- if you take 20 random linguists, their skill levels will likely follow a normal (bell-curve) distribution. So out of 20, you get about 3 great, maybe one exceptional, and 10 will be below average. For my project, having a \"great\" linguist was enough.\n\nFinding a pool of hundreds of specialists is easy nowadays¬†-Fiverr, Upwork, and other services help.\n\nHow do I evaluate skills? This part is straightforward. I needed linguists to create content in the form of lessons, so the test task was creating a lesson. Upon success, I gave two additional lessons to work closely with them and check communication skills.\n\nOf course, all interview tasks were paid at the candidate‚Äôs standard rate; otherwise, you can‚Äôt convince a dozen competent people to dedicate even a few hours of their time.\n\nTo find my Spanish linguist, I conducted seven interviews and hired the best one. The candidate was great: smart, creative, precise, and logical.\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve conducted nearly 100 interviews, and I‚Äôm very happy with the results. I hired five more linguists, and working with each of them is a delight.\n\nSo the playbook is as follows:\n\n1. **Skill distribution is a bell curve**: if you need great talent, run \\~10 interviews. If you need an exceptional one, be ready for 20+.\n2. **Evaluate with real work**: your interview/test should mirror the actual tasks.\n3. **Compatibility fit**: follow up with a collaboration task for communication and teamwork.\n\nOf course, this playbook isn‚Äôt applicable everywhere, but in many cases it can greatly simplify your headhunting process, and don‚Äôt use your social networks for hiring ‚Äì most likely, the \"talent\" you find will be the one no one else needed.\n\nThat‚Äôs it for today. If you want to check out my app, it‚Äôs called Natulang. It‚Äôs great on iOS or Mac (4.9 rating), not great on Android because of flawed speech recognition. It supports 8 languages now, and it‚Äôs really the fastest way to become conversational in a foreign language.",

Perhaps it's more of a personality issue. If you have problems in focusing to a single product and you always want to build something new and exciting, then perhaps that is a better strategy for you.

      "comments_text": "Congrats buddy For those that are curious about the background story, I actually wrote this the other day (for another post). It's a bit long but it gives the full context!\n\nOne year ago I finished my PhD in psychology (on repetitive negative thoughts/rumination and executive control). During my PhD I always struggled with procrastination, becoming too scattered, getting into too many rabbit holes, feeling like an impostor at times... sometimes working too much and sometimes not working enough.\n\nI had tried Notion and built a system. Then I switched to Obsidian. Then I had hybrid systems with turn by turn todoist, ticktick, habitica, and other task managers... I also found out that tracking my time was super helpful so I used rescuetime, then toggl, and then used Timeular for a while.\n\nI never found the one perfect app though (at the end of this post I also give my golden tips that helped me, regardless of the app). I was frustrated by existing productivity tools which gave you a lot of data without meaning. YOU as the user had to make them meaningful and analyze them. So I wanted to make a \"productivity\" app with a more psychological approach. In psychotherapy, you often start by clarifying \\*why\\* you come to therapy, why you are doing what you do. So I thought \"wouldn't it be cool if an app did the same?\". Then the productivity tools are just there to help you do more of what matters to you.\n\nMy dream was to have within one app: journaling, todos, time-tracking, a planner/calendar, etc. So that I could 1) look back and appreciate my progress, 2) focus in the present, 3) plan and prioritize the future. I'm not done yet, but I'm making progress on this.\n\nOf course I really wanted to finish my PhD so I did (+ academia doesn't pay well and you need to fight for funds), but then I started working on my app as soon as I finished!\n\nThe app is called \"orakemu\" ( [https://www.orakemu.com](https://www.orakemu.com) ) from two maori words, ora and kemu, meaning \"life\" and \"game\". The goal for me is that orakemu will become the only all-in-one gamified life management app that organizes your entire life through the roles you play. I sacrifice simplicity and minimalism to instead embrace the complexity of real life. This enables me to create a rich system and framework where tasks, time-tracking, habits, and projects are all interconnect through your Life Roles. The goal is to finally see and balance all aspects of our life in one place, helping us making conscious choices about where to invest our time and energy across our roles as Parent, Career Warrior, Creative Spirit, Being a Functional Adult, a Loving Partner, a Self-Care Sage and more.\n\nIt's already helping me stay on track, not lose track of time, and \"just do\" things by pressing play on tasks. I'm on a 245+ days streak of using orakemu\n\nCurrently I'm releasing v0.4.5 with  \n\\- life roles  \n\\- weekly XP/time stats  \n\\- a drag and drop timeline  \n\\- tasks  \n\\- flexible time-tracking  \n\\- dark mode\n\nup next:  \n\\- recurring tasks/routines/habits  \n\\- calendar integrations  \n\\- notes  \n\\- multiple timers at the same time\n\nEdit: added link to orakemu Why's your product? Congratulations! Wishing you more success. Congrats. Also working towards my first app.",

During my PhD I always struggled with procrastination, becoming too scattered, getting into too many rabbit holes, feeling like an impostor at times... sometimes working too much and sometimes not working enough.\n\nI had tried Notion and built a system. Then I switched to Obsidian. Then I had hybrid systems with turn by turn todoist, ticktick, habitica, and other task managers... I also found out that tracking my time was super helpful so I used rescuetime, then toggl, and then used Timeular for a while.\n\nI never found the one perfect app though (at the end of this post I also give my golden tips that helped me, regardless of the app). I was frustrated by existing productivity tools which gave you a lot of data without meaning. YOU as the user had to make them meaningful and analyze them. So I wanted to make a \"productivity\" app with a more psychological approach. In psychotherapy, you often start by clarifying \\*why\\* you come to therapy, why you are doing what you do. So I thought \"wouldn't it be cool if an app did the same?\". Then the productivity tools are just there to help you do more of what matters to you.\n\nMy dream was to have within one app: journaling, todos, time-tracking, a planner/calendar, etc. So that I could 1) look back and appreciate my progress, 2) focus in the present, 3) plan and prioritize the future. I'm not done yet, but I'm making progress on this.\n\nOf course I really wanted to finish my PhD so I did (+ academia doesn't pay well and you need to fight for funds), but then I started working on my app as soon as I finished!\n\nThe app is called \"orakemu\" ( [https://www.orakemu.com](https://www.orakemu.com) ) from two maori words, ora and kemu, meaning \"life\" and \"game\". The goal for me is that orakemu will become the only all-in-one gamified life management app that organizes your entire life through the roles you play. I sacrifice simplicity and minimalism to instead embrace the complexity of real life. This enables me to create a rich system and framework where tasks, time-tracking, habits, and projects are all interconnect through your Life Roles. The goal is to finally see and balance all aspects of our life in one place, helping us making conscious choices about where to invest our time and energy across our roles as Parent, Career Warrior, Creative Spirit, Being a Functional Adult, a Loving Partner, a Self-Care Sage and more.\n\nIt's already helping me stay on track, not lose track of time, and \"just do\" things by pressing play on tasks. I'm on a 245+ days streak of using orakemu\n\nCurrently I'm releasing v0.4.5 with  \n\\- life roles  \n\\- weekly XP/time stats  \n\\- a drag and drop timeline  \n\\- tasks  \n\\- flexible time-tracking  \n\\- dark mode\n\nup next:  \n\\- recurring tasks/routines/habits  \n\\- calendar integrations  \n\\- notes  \n\\- multiple timers at the same time\n\nEdit: added link to orakemu Why's your product? Congratulations! Wishing you more success. Congrats. Also working towards my first app.",

Or even after you come home from work. \n\nYour apps will remain blocked until you do your push-ups!\n\nThe app is built natively on SwiftUI. I use Apple's native Vision API to detect body parts and joints.  \n  \nI don't know what else to say so go on now and get the app!!  Nice one.\nCan you tell me more about the backend. \nI didnt even know this is possible Yo is this on playstore? Very cool idea. Is there such a thing as an emergency button? It could be that you really need your cell phone at that moment because of an emergency and it is not possible or inappropriate to do 5 push-ups first. Very nice üëç That is sick. Just a simple idea, but fun.",

Just you and your key.\n\n---\n\n### üîê How It Works\n\n- You generate a secure key in the app and give it a label.\n- Share it with your contact (you can use a QR code to keep it simple).\n- Then, when you're chatting, just:\n  - Type your message\n  - Tap **üîí Encrypt**\n  - Send the result\n- Your contact pastes it in their chat field and taps **üîì Decrypt**.\n\nIt‚Äôs all handled by the keyboard, so you can use it in **iMessage, Telegram, Messenger, Instagram DMs ‚Äî anywhere** you can type.\n\n---\n\n### üí° Why I Built It\n\nI didn‚Äôt want to rely on a chat app‚Äôs promise of privacy. I wanted **my own layer of control** ‚Äî something I could add on top of any platform. No logins, no external dependencies, no hidden analytics.\n\nJust me, my contacts, and the ability to scramble messages into something meaningless without the key.\n\n---\n\n### üí∏ One-Time Purchase\n\n- **No subscriptions**\n- **No ads**\n- **No data collection**\n- Just a one-time payment to support development and unlock lifetime access\n\n---\n\n### üì≤ Try It\n\nIf you're curious or privacy-minded like me, here's the App Store link:  \nüëâ [http://itunes.apple.com/app/id6747940676](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id6747940676)\n\nWould love to hear your feedback or thoughts ‚Äî and if you try it out, let me know how it goes. I‚Äôm already working on a few improvements based on early testers' ideas.\n\nThanks for reading üôè\n  Interesting project, this might actually be something that will be addressed in a few years when people wake up to the problems of Today‚Äôs technology Doesn't your phone read your keyboard anyway? Just dont use those chats, and use something like Signal This looks really cool! lol if I had any friends that were security minded I‚Äôd really like to use it.\n\nIf I had a suggestion though, and I‚Äôm not much of an app developer, but is it possible to save a few taps in the decrypt process by being able to tap and hold as if you were going to copy, then adding your own button that says decrypt?\n\nAnd then be able to edit the message only on the user side to show what the decrypted message would be without uploading the edit back up? This way it can be a more readable message exchange.\n\nIf you really want to make it fun, you could maybe set a mode called encrypted mode, that encrypts and decrypts all messages you type and receive automatically, this way it‚Äôs almost seamless to the user.",

Spent 3 days going back and forth with the AI tool. Every \"fix\" broke something else. Finally got it working but there's this ugly spacing issue that makes the whole thing look janky.\n\nI stare at that spacing every day.

You might mess up, but if you don't touch the product, it isn't going to get better.

      "title": "15 AI startup mistakes I did with my first product, Aiter.io (and how you can avoid them)",
      "selftext": "Hey, dear fellow side project hustlers! This is gonna be quite a long post (previous ones were shorter) because I will be sharing my experience from mistakes with my first side project and I made them a lot! üòÅ \n\n**My first startup gave me grey hairs at 31**, yet I don‚Äôt regret a thing. I just wish someone had told me the things I‚Äôm about to share right at the beginning of my founder journey ‚Äì maybe I could have avoided some of these costly startup mistakes. But hey, perhaps my story can save some time and stress for other entrepreneurs treading the same path? That's why I'm sharing it here\n\nA year and a half ago, my friend Val and I launched¬†[Aiter.io](https://aiter.io/)¬†‚Äì an AI MarTech startup designed to generate ads, social media content, and marketing strategy with a single click. We followed the classic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) playbook, building and launching it in just two weeks. It looked ugly as f\\*\\*k and was essentially just a¬†one-click AI ad generator (screenshot 2 in the gallery).\n\nBut we got our first positive user feedback and early traction, so we decided to push forward. And that‚Äôs where my long journey of pain, joy, and crucial lessons began.\n\n# Mistake #1: We didn't implement signup and payments from Day 0 and lost out on 50,000 potential users\n\nAdding a simple email signup and basic¬†Stripe integration¬†is only 2-3 days of development work. Yet we didn't do it, deciding to go \"lean\" to test our core hypothesis. As we discovered, this was¬†*too*¬†lean.\n\nA French TikToker found our product and¬†[posted a review](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMSQywgum)¬†(without us even knowing). It got 700k views overnight, driving 50,000 people to our website who wanted to try our AI tool. Because our product was free and didn't require a signup, we lost the massive opportunity to even collect their email addresses, not to mention any potential for monetisation. Of course, we added signups and Stripe later, but we've never had a viral traffic spike like that since.\n\n>**Conclusion #1:**¬†Don't be¬†*too*¬†lean. Always integrate basic user registration and a monetisation option (like Stripe) into your MVP from day one. This doesn't just prepare you for surprise traffic; it gives you much clearer data on whether users find your product valuable enough to pay for it.\n\n# Mistake #2: I resigned from my full-time job too early. It‚Äôs better to keep your side project a side one until you hit at least ~$5,000 in MRR\n\nAfter securing our first stable revenue (around $300-$500 a month üòÅ), I was convinced that scaling the business would be easy. I thought I just needed to invest X to get Y. After all, I‚Äôd spent 10 years in marketing! So, I switched to the full startup mode.\n\nGosh, that was a huge mistake. Because I only had savings for three months, growing a SaaS startup wasn‚Äôt as straightforward as I‚Äôd imagined. When my savings ran out, I had to start juggling multiple freelance jobs to pay the bills, which ended up taking even more time than my full-time role.\n\n>**Conclusion #2:**¬†If your main income is from a full-time job, don't quit to go all-in on your startup until its MRR is stable and can comfortably cover the salaries of all full-time founders/employees. Living in London, that benchmark for me would be at least $5,000 MRR (which we haven‚Äôt achieved yet üòÅ).\n\n# Mistake #3: I only had three months' worth of savings. It's better to have six, but the safest option is twelve. This is your startup runway\n\nWhen I ran out of savings, I fell into a vicious cycle: freelancing for my bread and butter, and only working on the startup with what little time was left. As a result, its MRR grew very slowly (we're currently at \\~$1,000-1,500), and we had no funds to reinvest in growth or marketing.\n\nThis meant we moved slower than the market and began to lose our competitive advantage. We‚Äôve since course-corrected by bringing on an awesome new team member (more on that later), but if I‚Äôd had a longer financial runway, we could have scaled much faster.\n\n>**Conclusion #3:**¬†Before you go \"full-time founder\", make sure you have a financial safety net. Aim for at least six months of living expenses in savings. A year's worth is even better.\n\n# Mistake #4: We didn't set up product analytics (like Amplitude, GA4, and Clarity) from Day 0\n\nAnother of our \"too lean\" mistakes was neglecting to implement product analytics from launch. Because of this, we had no clear data on which features our users loved the most, which directly led to Mistake #5.\n\n>**Conclusion #4:**¬†Set up your product analytics¬†*before*¬†you launch. It might take a day, but it will give you invaluable insights into user behaviour and help you find product-market fit. I'm a fan of Amplitude for its flexibility. However, you could also try Mixpanel, or if these tools are too complex for your team, start with a basic event tracking setup in Google Analytics 4. Microsoft Clarity is a must-have ‚Äì it‚Äôs free and shows you session recordings of your users, which will help you improve your UX and product.\n\n# Mistake #5: We went too broad with features instead of focusing on one core area and making it awesome\n\nInitially, Aiter only generated ad copy for Google, Facebook, and Instagram. I wish we‚Äôd stuck to that, focused on improving our product solely for the PPC market, and served that one niche audience.\n\nInstead, I fell into the classic trap of building a product \"for myself.\" As a full-stack marketer, over time, we added features for SMM, AI blog writing, email generation, and marketing strategy creation. As a result, our tool looks like this now (screenshot 3 in the gallery).\n\nSome might say it's cool that we have so many features. But this \"feature creep\" brings a whole bunch of problems:\n\n* The user onboarding process is more complex, which increases the learning curve and scares some potential customers away.\n* We now compete with much bigger, more established players than we should.\n* Managing and maintaining all these features is quite tiresome.\n* It's better to have one killer feature that stands out in the market than ten \"meh\" ones.\n* Marketing a broad, multi-feature tool is much harder than marketing a specialised solution.\n\nWe are now making changes to merge some features and make Aiter both more compact and useful. We are also considering launching a side project from our side project, just to test the hypothesis of how a more focused product might perform.\n\n>**Conclusion #5:**¬†Focus on a niche market segment and the core features that serve it. It is far better to be the best solution for a small group than an average one for a broad audience. This is the path to achieving true product-market fit.\n\n# Mistake #6: We went too broad with our marketing, too. It would have been better to focus on mastering just 1-2 channels\n\nWe wanted to discover what worked best for us, so we tried everything:\n\n* Startup and AI Directories\n* Google Ads\n* Meta Ads\n* Reddit Ads and organic posts\n* YouTube content marketing\n* Social Media Marketing (SMM) on LinkedIn\n* AI blogging for SEO\n* Email marketing\n\nAs a result, we achieved a little bit here and a little bit there ‚Äì but mastered nothing. In hindsight, it would have been much better to stick to 1-2 primary acquisition¬†channels and 1-2 supporting ones, and no more.\n\n**What worked well for our AI startup:**\n\n* **Startup and AI Directories.**¬†We became the¬†[\\#1 content generation tool on TAAFT](https://theresanaiforthat.com/s/aiter/), which consistently brings us high-quality leads and paying customers. Other directories also scraped our profile and listed us for free, which drove some good traffic.\n* **Organic Influencer Marketing.**¬†A few influencers found our tool and reviewed it, which brought some good traffic spikes. However, proactively finding the right influencers proved to be a problem, as the outreach process is tiresome, complex, and can be expensive. (We are currently considering working with influencer marketing platforms ‚Äì if you can recommend any, let me know!).\n* **YouTube Content Marketing** **(The Slow Burn).**¬†We created [eight educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/@aiter_io) about Aiter and digital marketing and saw a small spike in sales. However, to get substantial results from a YouTube marketing strategy, you need to be very systematic. We are considering investing more time here.\n* **Google Ads Retargeting.**¬†Showing ads to people who had already visited our website helped increase conversions. It was satisfying to use our own product to create ads that targeted different customer needs and objections.\n* **Email Marketing Workflows.**¬†This works well for us in terms of converting users who signed up for our free version into paying customers.\n\n**What didn‚Äôt work for us:**\n\n* **Paid Ads (Meta, Google & Reddit).**¬†This doesn‚Äôt mean the channels are ineffective; it just means you need a much larger advertising budget and a highly optimised landing page than we had. Our $500/month budget wasn't sufficient to get anywhere near a positive ROI.\n* **Product Hunt.**¬†More on this in Mistake #7.\n* **AI Blogging for SEO.**¬†We found that purely AI-generated articles don't rank well. Writing and promoting genuine, high-quality articles takes a lot of time and is a mid- to long-term content strategy.\n* **SMM.**¬†I can‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt work, but to get real results, it requires your full-time attention, which we couldn't afford. We are considering focusing more on LinkedIn or X (formerly Twitter), but I am more inclined to lean on YouTube.\n* **Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO).**¬†Our landing page isn‚Äôt bad, but it could be much better. Because we were spread too thin across so many marketing activities, we dedicated too little time to landing page optimisation. This is a critical oversight that takes time to fix.\n\n>**Conclusion #6:**¬†Identify the 1-2 marketing channels that bring you the best results and focus all your energy there. Ditch the rest. Support these primary channels with¬†**e**mail automation workflows and retargeting ads to convert leads. And once you have a glimmer of product-market fit, make landing page optimisation your top priority.\n\n# Mistake #7: We dedicated a whole MONTH to our Product Hunt launch. It should have taken two days\n\nProduct Hunt used to be a cool place to launch a product, get your first clients, attract media attention, and maybe even find an investor. Now, many founders feel it‚Äôs full of bots, you can't guarantee you'll be featured on the main page, and the results in terms of actual sales or user acquisition are often minuscule.\n\nWe didn't know this when we decided to launch, so we spent a month preparing the campaign and building a network of contacts to support it. In the end, our tool wasn't even featured on the main page due to a bug that the Product Hunt team acknowledged later.¬†[We got the most upvotes on the day](https://www.producthunt.com/products/aiter-io), but because we weren‚Äôt featured, it meant nothing.\n\nLater, talking to fellow founders in startup communities, I found out that this is a common story. Even becoming \"Product of the Day\" often gives you very little in terms of tangible results because, for many, the Product Hunt launch process has become a cargo cult.\n\n>**Conclusion #7:**¬†Don't get caught up in the hype of a Product Hunt launch. Create your launch page, ask your existing users and friends to subscribe to be notified, and if you get featured, post about it on your social channels. That‚Äôs it. Treat it as a good backlink for SEO and a small community announcement, nothing more.\n\n# Mistake #8: We wrote too many emails for our automation workflow (25 of them!)\n\nOur email onboarding sequence has over 25 emails. At least half of them were AI-generated. Surprisingly, they work and they do convert users. But having so many emails in the sequence makes it incredibly challenging and time-consuming to analyse and optimise them effectively.\n\n>**Conclusion #8:**¬†A well-designed and thoughtful email automation workflow with 7-10 high-quality emails is far better than a sequence of 25 average ones. It's easier to manage, test, and improve. And make no mistake: email marketing is still a fantastic channel for SaaS user conversion.\n\n# Mistake #9: We relied on the 'Lean Startup' principle too much. Instead, you should focus on quality right after validating demand\n\nI love the Lean Startup methodology ‚Äì the cycle of creating an MVP, checking for traction, and then improving iteratively. I use it in both product development and marketing. But I used it¬†*too much*.\n\nInstead of perfecting a feature or a marketing channel that was already working, I had a habit of saying, \"we'll improve this later\" while I chased other hypotheses. However, this creates significant technical debt and marketing debt. At some point, I realised I had to \"come back and improve\" far too many things, which was overwhelming.\n\nSo now, I'm a much bigger fan of the MLP (Minimum Lovable Product) principle. This means building a minimal product that is not just¬†*viable*, but¬†*lovable*. It means dedicating more time and care to whatever you do, whether it's building a new feature, recording a YouTube video, or writing a blog post.\n\n>**Conclusion #9:**¬†After you prove your key product hypothesis (i.e., you've got your first paying customers), switch from the pure \"lean\" mode to a more polished approach. One great, well-built feature works better than ten average ones. The same principle applies to your marketing content‚Äîquality always trumps quantity.\n\n# Mistake #10: Our landing page was part of the web app, which is terrible for SEO. Use Webflow or a similar platform for your static pages\n\nWe launched Aiter using a¬†monolithic architecture, combining our public-facing landing page and the app itself. While this is fast for initial development, it hurts your¬†technical SEO, and launching a blog becomes a complete pain in the arse.\n\nLater, we migrated our marketing site and blog to Webflow, which is a far more flexible and SEO-friendly option. I wish we had done so from the start ‚Äì it would have saved us a lot of time.\n\n>**Conclusion #10:**¬†Your landing pages and blog should be static pages, separate from your app's code. The best way to do this is with a platform like Webflow or WordPress. Crucially, make sure both the app and the marketing site are on the same root domain (using subfolders like example.com/blog instead of subdomains like blog.example.com). It's a bit trickier to set up, but it's much better for¬†SEO performance, as Google consolidates all ranking signals to one domain.\n\n# Mistake #11: Not having enough developers on your founding team\n\nAt the start, there were only two of us. My partner, Val, is a brilliant CTO, but he is also a full-time co-founder at another startup, so his involvement with Aiter is part-time. This was fine initially, but over time, we noticed that our limited¬†development bandwidth, combined with the other strategic mistakes listed here, meant we couldn't always keep pace with the market.\n\nWe‚Äôve since fixed this by bringing on another great developer and UX designer, Oleg, and we are also considering onboarding more developers. However, it's much better to have enough engineering firepower from day one.\n\n>**Conclusion #11:**¬†Your startup team should have at least one full-time developer completely dedicated to the product. Without it, your speed of iteration will suffer.\n\n# Mistake #12: Don't pitch for funding until you hit at least $3,000 MRR (unless your product is research-heavy or you're Sam Altman)\n\nI looked at the whole startup-investor world through rose-coloured glasses. I thought that because we were in a promising industry and had some early traction, securing a pre-seed funding round would be easy.\n\nWe had around twenty pitches, which was good practice. However, we quickly came to the conclusion (later verified by other founders I know) that until your product has at least $3,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue, there is little point in pitching to most investors. We did find one interested party, but the term sheet they offered was not too good. We also applied for some startup grants, and while we've had some progress there, the process is incredibly tedious and long. It's an \"apply and forget\" kind of thing.\n\n>**Conclusion #12:**¬†Don't waste your time chasing investors until your product is generating at least $3,000 MRR. Hitting $5,000 is an even better benchmark. This advice doesn't apply to research-heavy products or serial entrepreneurs who have successfully raised funds before.\n\n# Mistake #13: We didn't set up a referral programme from Day 0\n\nWord-of-mouth is one of the most powerful growth channels (and it was the main one for us). However, we didn't implement a reward programme for users who invited others because we assumed it would be too complicated to build. We lost a lot of great opportunities this way, as users kept asking us for a referral scheme.\n\nWe were wrong ‚Äì there are off-the-shelf solutions that allow you to set up a programme very quickly. We're in the process of integrating PromoteKit right now, and we also considered TrackDesk as an alternative.\n\n>**Conclusion #13:**¬†Launch a referral marketing programme from Day 0 using a dedicated tool. It‚Äôs much easier than it seems and creates a powerful, self-sustaining customer acquisition channel.\n\n# Mistake #14: We ignored collecting reviews on sites like G2 for too long\n\nG2 is a top website for B2B software reviews. If your product has positive reviews there, you get a powerful backlink, as well as high-intent traffic and new customers.\n\nWe thought setting up a profile would take too long, which is why we only did it a year and a half after launching. [It took us just half an hour](https://www.g2.com/products/aiter-io/reviews) üòÅ\n\n>**Conclusion #14:**¬†Set up your G2 and Capterra profiles right from the start. Ask your happy customers for reviews as soon as possible. This social proof is your online reputation and will boost growth at every stage of your marketing funnel.\n\n# Mistake #15: We ignored SEO for too long\n\nWe built up a decent Domain Authority organically through directory listings and word-of-mouth. However, we wasted this asset by neglecting to build a proper semantic core (keyword strategy) or strategically acquire backlinks. As a result, we get some organic traffic, but not nearly as much as we could.\n\n>**Conclusion #15:**¬†Think about your startup SEO strategy from Day 0. Identify relevant long-tail keywords to target and use them in your page titles, meta descriptions, and headings. Once you have product-market fit, aim to build at least one high-quality backlink per month. It's a long-term investment that really pays off.\n\n# Conclusion of conlusions: focus, have fun, talk to users, and set up infrastructure from Day 0\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd recommend:\n\n* **Focus on one core problem for one core audience.**¬†Don't get distracted by building a tool for everyone. Master your niche first.\n* **Find the joy in building something**¬†***lovable*****, not just**¬†***viable*****.**¬†Once you have early traction, shift your mindset from a scrappy MVP to a polished, high-quality product that users genuinely love.\n* **Build your foundational infrastructure from Day 0.**¬†This includes product analytics, basic SEO, and a process for collecting reviews. Don't create technical and marketing debt you'll have to pay back later.\n* **Talk to your users constantly.**¬†They are your ultimate source of truth and your best guide for finding product-market fit.\n\nI hope that sharing my¬†**founder journey**¬†‚Äì mistakes and all ‚Äì helps other entrepreneurs on this path save some time, stress, and money. \n\nPlease share your tools, questions, feedback and mistakes ‚Äì I will be happy to hear your story, discuss and exchange experiences.

Living in London, that benchmark for me would be at least $5,000 MRR (which we haven‚Äôt achieved yet üòÅ).\n\n# Mistake #3: I only had three months' worth of savings. It's better to have six, but the safest option is twelve. This is your startup runway\n\nWhen I ran out of savings, I fell into a vicious cycle: freelancing for my bread and butter, and only working on the startup with what little time was left. As a result, its MRR grew very slowly (we're currently at \\~$1,000-1,500), and we had no funds to reinvest in growth or marketing.\n\nThis meant we moved slower than the market and began to lose our competitive advantage. We‚Äôve since course-corrected by bringing on an awesome new team member (more on that later), but if I‚Äôd had a longer financial runway, we could have scaled much faster.\n\n>**Conclusion #3:**¬†Before you go \"full-time founder\", make sure you have a financial safety net. Aim for at least six months of living expenses in savings. A year's worth is even better.\n\n# Mistake #4: We didn't set up product analytics (like Amplitude, GA4, and Clarity) from Day 0\n\nAnother of our \"too lean\" mistakes was neglecting to implement product analytics from launch. Because of this, we had no clear data on which features our users loved the most, which directly led to Mistake #5.\n\n>**Conclusion #4:**¬†Set up your product analytics¬†*before*¬†you launch. It might take a day, but it will give you invaluable insights into user behaviour and help you find product-market fit. I'm a fan of Amplitude for its flexibility. However, you could also try Mixpanel, or if these tools are too complex for your team, start with a basic event tracking setup in Google Analytics 4. Microsoft Clarity is a must-have ‚Äì it‚Äôs free and shows you session recordings of your users, which will help you improve your UX and product.\n\n# Mistake #5: We went too broad with features instead of focusing on one core area and making it awesome\n\nInitially, Aiter only generated ad copy for Google, Facebook, and Instagram. I wish we‚Äôd stuck to that, focused on improving our product solely for the PPC market, and served that one niche audience.\n\nInstead, I fell into the classic trap of building a product \"for myself.\" As a full-stack marketer, over time, we added features for SMM, AI blog writing, email generation, and marketing strategy creation. As a result, our tool looks like this now (screenshot 3 in the gallery).\n\nSome might say it's cool that we have so many features. But this \"feature creep\" brings a whole bunch of problems:\n\n* The user onboarding process is more complex, which increases the learning curve and scares some potential customers away.\n* We now compete with much bigger, more established players than we should.\n* Managing and maintaining all these features is quite tiresome.\n* It's better to have one killer feature that stands out in the market than ten \"meh\" ones.\n* Marketing a broad, multi-feature tool is much harder than marketing a specialised solution.\n\nWe are now making changes to merge some features and make Aiter both more compact and useful. We are also considering launching a side project from our side project, just to test the hypothesis of how a more focused product might perform.\n\n>**Conclusion #5:**¬†Focus on a niche market segment and the core features that serve it. It is far better to be the best solution for a small group than an average one for a broad audience. This is the path to achieving true product-market fit.\n\n# Mistake #6: We went too broad with our marketing, too. It would have been better to focus on mastering just 1-2 channels\n\nWe wanted to discover what worked best for us, so we tried everything:\n\n* Startup and AI Directories\n* Google Ads\n* Meta Ads\n* Reddit Ads and organic posts\n* YouTube content marketing\n* Social Media Marketing (SMM) on LinkedIn\n* AI blogging for SEO\n* Email marketing\n\nAs a result, we achieved a little bit here and a little bit there ‚Äì but mastered nothing. In hindsight, it would have been much better to stick to 1-2 primary acquisition¬†channels and 1-2 supporting ones, and no more.\n\n**What worked well for our AI startup:**\n\n* **Startup and AI Directories.**¬†We became the¬†[\\#1 content generation tool on TAAFT](https://theresanaiforthat.com/s/aiter/), which consistently brings us high-quality leads and paying customers. Other directories also scraped our profile and listed us for free, which drove some good traffic.\n* **Organic Influencer Marketing.**¬†A few influencers found our tool and reviewed it, which brought some good traffic spikes. However, proactively finding the right influencers proved to be a problem, as the outreach process is tiresome, complex, and can be expensive. (We are currently considering working with influencer marketing platforms ‚Äì if you can recommend any, let me know!).\n* **YouTube Content Marketing** **(The Slow Burn).**¬†We created [eight educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/@aiter_io) about Aiter and digital marketing and saw a small spike in sales. However, to get substantial results from a YouTube marketing strategy, you need to be very systematic. We are considering investing more time here.\n* **Google Ads Retargeting.**¬†Showing ads to people who had already visited our website helped increase conversions. It was satisfying to use our own product to create ads that targeted different customer needs and objections.\n* **Email Marketing Workflows.**¬†This works well for us in terms of converting users who signed up for our free version into paying customers.\n\n**What didn‚Äôt work for us:**\n\n* **Paid Ads (Meta, Google & Reddit).**¬†This doesn‚Äôt mean the channels are ineffective; it just means you need a much larger advertising budget and a highly optimised landing page than we had. Our $500/month budget wasn't sufficient to get anywhere near a positive ROI.\n* **Product Hunt.**¬†More on this in Mistake #7.\n* **AI Blogging for SEO.**¬†We found that purely AI-generated articles don't rank well. Writing and promoting genuine, high-quality articles takes a lot of time and is a mid- to long-term content strategy.\n* **SMM.**¬†I can‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt work, but to get real results, it requires your full-time attention, which we couldn't afford. We are considering focusing more on LinkedIn or X (formerly Twitter), but I am more inclined to lean on YouTube.\n* **Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO).**¬†Our landing page isn‚Äôt bad, but it could be much better. Because we were spread too thin across so many marketing activities, we dedicated too little time to landing page optimisation. This is a critical oversight that takes time to fix.\n\n>**Conclusion #6:**¬†Identify the 1-2 marketing channels that bring you the best results and focus all your energy there. Ditch the rest. Support these primary channels with¬†**e**mail automation workflows and retargeting ads to convert leads. And once you have a glimmer of product-market fit, make landing page optimisation your top priority.\n\n# Mistake #7: We dedicated a whole MONTH to our Product Hunt launch. It should have taken two days\n\nProduct Hunt used to be a cool place to launch a product, get your first clients, attract media attention, and maybe even find an investor. Now, many founders feel it‚Äôs full of bots, you can't guarantee you'll be featured on the main page, and the results in terms of actual sales or user acquisition are often minuscule.\n\nWe didn't know this when we decided to launch, so we spent a month preparing the campaign and building a network of contacts to support it. In the end, our tool wasn't even featured on the main page due to a bug that the Product Hunt team acknowledged later.¬†[We got the most upvotes on the day](https://www.producthunt.com/products/aiter-io), but because we weren‚Äôt featured, it meant nothing.\n\nLater, talking to fellow founders in startup communities, I found out that this is a common story. Even becoming \"Product of the Day\" often gives you very little in terms of tangible results because, for many, the Product Hunt launch process has become a cargo cult.\n\n>**Conclusion #7:**¬†Don't get caught up in the hype of a Product Hunt launch. Create your launch page, ask your existing users and friends to subscribe to be notified, and if you get featured, post about it on your social channels. That‚Äôs it. Treat it as a good backlink for SEO and a small community announcement, nothing more.\n\n# Mistake #8: We wrote too many emails for our automation workflow (25 of them!)\n\nOur email onboarding sequence has over 25 emails. At least half of them were AI-generated. Surprisingly, they work and they do convert users. But having so many emails in the sequence makes it incredibly challenging and time-consuming to analyse and optimise them effectively.\n\n>**Conclusion #8:**¬†A well-designed and thoughtful email automation workflow with 7-10 high-quality emails is far better than a sequence of 25 average ones. It's easier to manage, test, and improve. And make no mistake: email marketing is still a fantastic channel for SaaS user conversion.\n\n# Mistake #9: We relied on the 'Lean Startup' principle too much. Instead, you should focus on quality right after validating demand\n\nI love the Lean Startup methodology ‚Äì the cycle of creating an MVP, checking for traction, and then improving iteratively. I use it in both product development and marketing. But I used it¬†*too much*.\n\nInstead of perfecting a feature or a marketing channel that was already working, I had a habit of saying, \"we'll improve this later\" while I chased other hypotheses. However, this creates significant technical debt and marketing debt. At some point, I realised I had to \"come back and improve\" far too many things, which was overwhelming.\n\nSo now, I'm a much bigger fan of the MLP (Minimum Lovable Product) principle. This means building a minimal product that is not just¬†*viable*, but¬†*lovable*. It means dedicating more time and care to whatever you do, whether it's building a new feature, recording a YouTube video, or writing a blog post.\n\n>**Conclusion #9:**¬†After you prove your key product hypothesis (i.e., you've got your first paying customers), switch from the pure \"lean\" mode to a more polished approach. One great, well-built feature works better than ten average ones. The same principle applies to your marketing content‚Äîquality always trumps quantity.\n\n# Mistake #10: Our landing page was part of the web app, which is terrible for SEO. Use Webflow or a similar platform for your static pages\n\nWe launched Aiter using a¬†monolithic architecture, combining our public-facing landing page and the app itself. While this is fast for initial development, it hurts your¬†technical SEO, and launching a blog becomes a complete pain in the arse.\n\nLater, we migrated our marketing site and blog to Webflow, which is a far more flexible and SEO-friendly option. I wish we had done so from the start ‚Äì it would have saved us a lot of time.\n\n>**Conclusion #10:**¬†Your landing pages and blog should be static pages, separate from your app's code. The best way to do this is with a platform like Webflow or WordPress. Crucially, make sure both the app and the marketing site are on the same root domain (using subfolders like example.com/blog instead of subdomains like blog.example.com). It's a bit trickier to set up, but it's much better for¬†SEO performance, as Google consolidates all ranking signals to one domain.\n\n# Mistake #11: Not having enough developers on your founding team\n\nAt the start, there were only two of us. My partner, Val, is a brilliant CTO, but he is also a full-time co-founder at another startup, so his involvement with Aiter is part-time. This was fine initially, but over time, we noticed that our limited¬†development bandwidth, combined with the other strategic mistakes listed here, meant we couldn't always keep pace with the market.\n\nWe‚Äôve since fixed this by bringing on another great developer and UX designer, Oleg, and we are also considering onboarding more developers. However, it's much better to have enough engineering firepower from day one.\n\n>**Conclusion #11:**¬†Your startup team should have at least one full-time developer completely dedicated to the product. Without it, your speed of iteration will suffer.\n\n# Mistake #12: Don't pitch for funding until you hit at least $3,000 MRR (unless your product is research-heavy or you're Sam Altman)\n\nI looked at the whole startup-investor world through rose-coloured glasses. I thought that because we were in a promising industry and had some early traction, securing a pre-seed funding round would be easy.\n\nWe had around twenty pitches, which was good practice. However, we quickly came to the conclusion (later verified by other founders I know) that until your product has at least $3,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue, there is little point in pitching to most investors. We did find one interested party, but the term sheet they offered was not too good. We also applied for some startup grants, and while we've had some progress there, the process is incredibly tedious and long. It's an \"apply and forget\" kind of thing.\n\n>**Conclusion #12:**¬†Don't waste your time chasing investors until your product is generating at least $3,000 MRR. Hitting $5,000 is an even better benchmark. This advice doesn't apply to research-heavy products or serial entrepreneurs who have successfully raised funds before.\n\n# Mistake #13: We didn't set up a referral programme from Day 0\n\nWord-of-mouth is one of the most powerful growth channels (and it was the main one for us). However, we didn't implement a reward programme for users who invited others because we assumed it would be too complicated to build. We lost a lot of great opportunities this way, as users kept asking us for a referral scheme.\n\nWe were wrong ‚Äì there are off-the-shelf solutions that allow you to set up a programme very quickly. We're in the process of integrating PromoteKit right now, and we also considered TrackDesk as an alternative.\n\n>**Conclusion #13:**¬†Launch a referral marketing programme from Day 0 using a dedicated tool. It‚Äôs much easier than it seems and creates a powerful, self-sustaining customer acquisition channel.\n\n# Mistake #14: We ignored collecting reviews on sites like G2 for too long\n\nG2 is a top website for B2B software reviews. If your product has positive reviews there, you get a powerful backlink, as well as high-intent traffic and new customers.\n\nWe thought setting up a profile would take too long, which is why we only did it a year and a half after launching. [It took us just half an hour](https://www.g2.com/products/aiter-io/reviews) üòÅ\n\n>**Conclusion #14:**¬†Set up your G2 and Capterra profiles right from the start. Ask your happy customers for reviews as soon as possible. This social proof is your online reputation and will boost growth at every stage of your marketing funnel.\n\n# Mistake #15: We ignored SEO for too long\n\nWe built up a decent Domain Authority organically through directory listings and word-of-mouth. However, we wasted this asset by neglecting to build a proper semantic core (keyword strategy) or strategically acquire backlinks. As a result, we get some organic traffic, but not nearly as much as we could.\n\n>**Conclusion #15:**¬†Think about your startup SEO strategy from Day 0. Identify relevant long-tail keywords to target and use them in your page titles, meta descriptions, and headings. Once you have product-market fit, aim to build at least one high-quality backlink per month. It's a long-term investment that really pays off.\n\n# Conclusion of conlusions: focus, have fun, talk to users, and set up infrastructure from Day 0\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd recommend:\n\n* **Focus on one core problem for one core audience.**¬†Don't get distracted by building a tool for everyone. Master your niche first.\n* **Find the joy in building something**¬†***lovable*****, not just**¬†***viable*****.**¬†Once you have early traction, shift your mindset from a scrappy MVP to a polished, high-quality product that users genuinely love.\n* **Build your foundational infrastructure from Day 0.**¬†This includes product analytics, basic SEO, and a process for collecting reviews. Don't create technical and marketing debt you'll have to pay back later.\n* **Talk to your users constantly.**¬†They are your ultimate source of truth and your best guide for finding product-market fit.\n\nI hope that sharing my¬†**founder journey**¬†‚Äì mistakes and all ‚Äì helps other entrepreneurs on this path save some time, stress, and money. \n\nPlease share your tools, questions, feedback and mistakes ‚Äì I will be happy to hear your story, discuss and exchange experiences. May the Force of all startup spirits be with you üòâ",
      "comments_text": "Hey, thanks for sharing such a real, detailed founder story! This is exactly the kind of stuff you don‚Äôt learn from books, just straight-up, hard-earned lessons.\n\nThe ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be too lean‚Äù advice hits me hard. I‚Äôve seen so many people skip basic stuff like signups or analytics to move fast, but then it bites them later. Those little things really matter.\n\nAlso, the focus part, both on product and marketing, is spot on. Trying to do everything at once just drains you. Finding that one niche, and owning it, is where the magic really starts.\n\nAnd that note about runway, and not quitting your job too soon? Such a solid reality check. So many founders overlook that, and get burned. (i quit my job after investment :D lol )\n\nIn my own journey building Sniff, we faced a lot of the same stuff, balancing focus, managing runway, picking the right channels to get early users. Starting community engagement early, and staying consistent, really helped us get a small but solid group before we even launched.\n\nWould love to know, after trying so many marketing channels, how did you decide where to really double down? What worked best for Aiter?\n\nReally appreciate you sharing all this, it‚Äôs super helpful and inspiring for anyone grinding through those early startup days! üôå Great breakdown, thank you , just a question.\n\nDid you run your frontend on dev server lol? I can see all the envs (stripe, firebase, amplittude) in the react code and pnpm modules used So much important information. Thank you The number 1 mistake I'm doing with my site whatthefood .io\n\nI'll make sure to roll out a saas update as soon as possible.\n\nOverall, very inspiring bro",
      "full_text_content": "15 AI startup mistakes I did with my first product, Aiter.io (and how you can avoid them) Hey, dear fellow side project hustlers! This is gonna be quite a long post (previous ones were shorter) because I will be sharing my experience from mistakes with my first side project and I made them a lot! üòÅ \n\n**My first startup gave me grey hairs at 31**, yet I don‚Äôt regret a thing. I just wish someone had told me the things I‚Äôm about to share right at the beginning of my founder journey ‚Äì maybe I could have avoided some of these costly startup mistakes. But hey, perhaps my story can save some time and stress for other entrepreneurs treading the same path? That's why I'm sharing it here\n\nA year and a half ago, my friend Val and I launched¬†[Aiter.io](https://aiter.io/)¬†‚Äì an AI MarTech startup designed to generate ads, social media content, and marketing strategy with a single click. We followed the classic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) playbook, building and launching it in just two weeks. It looked ugly as f\\*\\*k and was essentially just a¬†one-click AI ad generator (screenshot 2 in the gallery).\n\nBut we got our first positive user feedback and early traction, so we decided to push forward. And that‚Äôs where my long journey of pain, joy, and crucial lessons began.\n\n# Mistake #1: We didn't implement signup and payments from Day 0 and lost out on 50,000 potential users\n\nAdding a simple email signup and basic¬†Stripe integration¬†is only 2-3 days of development work. Yet we didn't do it, deciding to go \"lean\" to test our core hypothesis. As we discovered, this was¬†*too*¬†lean.\n\nA French TikToker found our product and¬†[posted a review](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMSQywgum)¬†(without us even knowing). It got 700k views overnight, driving 50,000 people to our website who wanted to try our AI tool. Because our product was free and didn't require a signup, we lost the massive opportunity to even collect their email addresses, not to mention any potential for monetisation. Of course, we added signups and Stripe later, but we've never had a viral traffic spike like that since.\n\n>**Conclusion #1:**¬†Don't be¬†*too*¬†lean. Always integrate basic user registration and a monetisation option (like Stripe) into your MVP from day one. This doesn't just prepare you for surprise traffic; it gives you much clearer data on whether users find your product valuable enough to pay for it.\n\n# Mistake #2: I resigned from my full-time job too early. It‚Äôs better to keep your side project a side one until you hit at least ~$5,000 in MRR\n\nAfter securing our first stable revenue (around $300-$500 a month üòÅ), I was convinced that scaling the business would be easy. I thought I just needed to invest X to get Y. After all, I‚Äôd spent 10 years in marketing! So, I switched to the full startup mode.\n\nGosh, that was a huge mistake. Because I only had savings for three months, growing a SaaS startup wasn‚Äôt as straightforward as I‚Äôd imagined. When my savings ran out, I had to start juggling multiple freelance jobs to pay the bills, which ended up taking even more time than my full-time role.\n\n>**Conclusion #2:**¬†If your main income is from a full-time job, don't quit to go all-in on your startup until its MRR is stable and can comfortably cover the salaries of all full-time founders/employees.

It means dedicating more time and care to whatever you do, whether it's building a new feature, recording a YouTube video, or writing a blog post.\n\n>**Conclusion #9:**¬†After you prove your key product hypothesis (i.e., you've got your first paying customers), switch from the pure \"lean\" mode to a more polished approach. One great, well-built feature works better than ten average ones. The same principle applies to your marketing content‚Äîquality always trumps quantity.\n\n# Mistake #10: Our landing page was part of the web app, which is terrible for SEO. Use Webflow or a similar platform for your static pages\n\nWe launched Aiter using a¬†monolithic architecture, combining our public-facing landing page and the app itself. While this is fast for initial development, it hurts your¬†technical SEO, and launching a blog becomes a complete pain in the arse.\n\nLater, we migrated our marketing site and blog to Webflow, which is a far more flexible and SEO-friendly option. I wish we had done so from the start ‚Äì it would have saved us a lot of time.\n\n>**Conclusion #10:**¬†Your landing pages and blog should be static pages, separate from your app's code. The best way to do this is with a platform like Webflow or WordPress. Crucially, make sure both the app and the marketing site are on the same root domain (using subfolders like example.com/blog instead of subdomains like blog.example.com). It's a bit trickier to set up, but it's much better for¬†SEO performance, as Google consolidates all ranking signals to one domain.\n\n# Mistake #11: Not having enough developers on your founding team\n\nAt the start, there were only two of us. My partner, Val, is a brilliant CTO, but he is also a full-time co-founder at another startup, so his involvement with Aiter is part-time. This was fine initially, but over time, we noticed that our limited¬†development bandwidth, combined with the other strategic mistakes listed here, meant we couldn't always keep pace with the market.\n\nWe‚Äôve since fixed this by bringing on another great developer and UX designer, Oleg, and we are also considering onboarding more developers. However, it's much better to have enough engineering firepower from day one.\n\n>**Conclusion #11:**¬†Your startup team should have at least one full-time developer completely dedicated to the product. Without it, your speed of iteration will suffer.\n\n# Mistake #12: Don't pitch for funding until you hit at least $3,000 MRR (unless your product is research-heavy or you're Sam Altman)\n\nI looked at the whole startup-investor world through rose-coloured glasses. I thought that because we were in a promising industry and had some early traction, securing a pre-seed funding round would be easy.\n\nWe had around twenty pitches, which was good practice. However, we quickly came to the conclusion (later verified by other founders I know) that until your product has at least $3,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue, there is little point in pitching to most investors. We did find one interested party, but the term sheet they offered was not too good. We also applied for some startup grants, and while we've had some progress there, the process is incredibly tedious and long. It's an \"apply and forget\" kind of thing.\n\n>**Conclusion #12:**¬†Don't waste your time chasing investors until your product is generating at least $3,000 MRR. Hitting $5,000 is an even better benchmark. This advice doesn't apply to research-heavy products or serial entrepreneurs who have successfully raised funds before.\n\n# Mistake #13: We didn't set up a referral programme from Day 0\n\nWord-of-mouth is one of the most powerful growth channels (and it was the main one for us). However, we didn't implement a reward programme for users who invited others because we assumed it would be too complicated to build. We lost a lot of great opportunities this way, as users kept asking us for a referral scheme.\n\nWe were wrong ‚Äì there are off-the-shelf solutions that allow you to set up a programme very quickly. We're in the process of integrating PromoteKit right now, and we also considered TrackDesk as an alternative.\n\n>**Conclusion #13:**¬†Launch a referral marketing programme from Day 0 using a dedicated tool. It‚Äôs much easier than it seems and creates a powerful, self-sustaining customer acquisition channel.\n\n# Mistake #14: We ignored collecting reviews on sites like G2 for too long\n\nG2 is a top website for B2B software reviews. If your product has positive reviews there, you get a powerful backlink, as well as high-intent traffic and new customers.\n\nWe thought setting up a profile would take too long, which is why we only did it a year and a half after launching. [It took us just half an hour](https://www.g2.com/products/aiter-io/reviews) üòÅ\n\n>**Conclusion #14:**¬†Set up your G2 and Capterra profiles right from the start. Ask your happy customers for reviews as soon as possible. This social proof is your online reputation and will boost growth at every stage of your marketing funnel.\n\n# Mistake #15: We ignored SEO for too long\n\nWe built up a decent Domain Authority organically through directory listings and word-of-mouth. However, we wasted this asset by neglecting to build a proper semantic core (keyword strategy) or strategically acquire backlinks. As a result, we get some organic traffic, but not nearly as much as we could.\n\n>**Conclusion #15:**¬†Think about your startup SEO strategy from Day 0. Identify relevant long-tail keywords to target and use them in your page titles, meta descriptions, and headings. Once you have product-market fit, aim to build at least one high-quality backlink per month. It's a long-term investment that really pays off.\n\n# Conclusion of conlusions: focus, have fun, talk to users, and set up infrastructure from Day 0\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd recommend:\n\n* **Focus on one core problem for one core audience.**¬†Don't get distracted by building a tool for everyone. Master your niche first.\n* **Find the joy in building something**¬†***lovable*****, not just**¬†***viable*****.**¬†Once you have early traction, shift your mindset from a scrappy MVP to a polished, high-quality product that users genuinely love.\n* **Build your foundational infrastructure from Day 0.**¬†This includes product analytics, basic SEO, and a process for collecting reviews. Don't create technical and marketing debt you'll have to pay back later.\n* **Talk to your users constantly.**¬†They are your ultimate source of truth and your best guide for finding product-market fit.\n\nI hope that sharing my¬†**founder journey**¬†‚Äì mistakes and all ‚Äì helps other entrepreneurs on this path save some time, stress, and money. \n\nPlease share your tools, questions, feedback and mistakes ‚Äì I will be happy to hear your story, discuss and exchange experiences. May the Force of all startup spirits be with you üòâ  Hey, thanks for sharing such a real, detailed founder story! This is exactly the kind of stuff you don‚Äôt learn from books, just straight-up, hard-earned lessons.\n\nThe ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be too lean‚Äù advice hits me hard. I‚Äôve seen so many people skip basic stuff like signups or analytics to move fast, but then it bites them later. Those little things really matter.\n\nAlso, the focus part, both on product and marketing, is spot on. Trying to do everything at once just drains you. Finding that one niche, and owning it, is where the magic really starts.\n\nAnd that note about runway, and not quitting your job too soon? Such a solid reality check. So many founders overlook that, and get burned. (i quit my job after investment :D lol )\n\nIn my own journey building Sniff, we faced a lot of the same stuff, balancing focus, managing runway, picking the right channels to get early users. Starting community engagement early, and staying consistent, really helped us get a small but solid group before we even launched.\n\nWould love to know, after trying so many marketing channels, how did you decide where to really double down? What worked best for Aiter?\n\nReally appreciate you sharing all this, it‚Äôs super helpful and inspiring for anyone grinding through those early startup days! üôå Great breakdown, thank you , just a question.\n\nDid you run your frontend on dev server lol? I can see all the envs (stripe, firebase, amplittude) in the react code and pnpm modules used So much important information. Thank you The number 1 mistake I'm doing with my site whatthefood .io\n\nI'll make sure to roll out a saas update as soon as possible.\n\nOverall, very inspiring bro",

I enjoyed the job and was leading a team, but i always wanted to do my own thing. i called the founders and told them i was quitting. they were super understanding and happy for me, and even offered to invest.\n\nafter a bit of rest, i went full speed again. the inbound interest was insane. i had so many **VCs dm'ing me**, people reaching out trying to **acquire the product** outright, and tons of investment offers.  \ni lined up meetings, met some amazing investors (and some horrible ones too), and eventually **closed a pre-seed fundraise**. the raise was led by Nebular VC. i also secured **funding from Guillermo Rauch**, which was absolutely surreal. what really inspired confidence is that many investors said they were investing in *me*, my ability to ship fast and create hype, and were making a character bet.\n\ni also had **journalists reach out to ask about my story.** i even got some articles written about me online and in the newspaper, which my parents were really chuffed about lol.\n\nsince then i've been grinding hard on product. i've **hired a full-time engineer** who's been absolutely amazing. we've been building in public on X, and it's been incredible. the community is amazing - we've had people redesign the landing page, design the logo, and contribute to the code.\n\nthe whole experience has been thrilling. to be honest, at times it's been very stressful and overwhelming. i'm really honestly just figuring most of this out as i go, from fundraising to building a team to marketing. my only regret is not putting up a paywall sooner. i wanted it to be refined enough first, but we've finally added it recently.\n\noverall though i'm still extremely confident in my ability to ship fast and continue to build things that are unique, exciting, and meaningful.\n\ni'd love for you to try out Lucid: [lucid.so](http://lucid.so)  \nthanks for listening!  Looks like you repackaged ChatGPT with context rules, good luck! Just signed up via Google auth, then I am immediately presented with this error:\n\n    Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading www.lucid.so (see the browser console for more information).\n\nThe console shows some 404s, CORS, cookies with wrong domain...\n\nHopefully this is just a transient issue :-) Why does everything have to be some fuck-ass AI wrapper bro, I'm so tired. Very cool! biggest learning from the journey? So its an AI with Texteditor rather than a Texteditor with AI. Interesting‚Ä¶",

But otherwise you should negotiate for a higher price, something that will make you happy enough to not second guess later and truly move on.

      "full_text_content": "Someone offered me $6K for a little book app I built for fun ‚Äî not sure if I should sell it or not. UPDATE: Hey everyone just wanted to share a quick update after my original post.\n\nAfter reading through all your amazing comments, talking with family, and reflecting on the amzing support I got from this community‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve decided to counter with a $20K offer.\n\nIf they decline, honestly, I‚Äôm totally at peace with continuing to build it as a community driven space for book lovers. Maybe it stays small, maybe it grows. But even without chasing revenue, it‚Äôs become something I‚Äôm genuinely proud of.\n\nI‚Äôm super grateful I had the courage to share my story here. This community completely shifted my mindset and gave me a ton of clarity and inspiration. üôè\n\nTomorrow evening I‚Äôll be having a call with the buyer to see where things go. I‚Äôll make sure to keep you all updated on how it unfolds.  \n  \nAnd wild side note: two BookTok creators shared the app recently, and we‚Äôre now closing in on 1,000 users. Mind blowing.\n\nThanks again to everyone who took the time to reply. You‚Äôve made a real difference.\n\n  \nSo a few weeks ago, I launched a small side project called [BookSnap](https://booksnap.pro)  \nBuilt it in a month. No plans, no monetization, no marketing budget. Just something I wished existed.\n\nYou snap a book cover (or type a title)  \nIt's like a one-stop shop for heavy readers, like me,  breakdown (summary, vibe, pros/cons), plus mood-based recs, spicy opinions, quote cards, etc.  \nBasically, smarter reading. No regrets.\n\nI never planned to make a living out of it. It was just‚Ä¶ personal.  \nBut then‚Ä¶ it kind of took off.  \n300 users, all organic. Mostly in the last 2 weeks.  \nGreat feedback. People actually use it.\n\nNow here‚Äôs the twist:  \nGot a message from a guy representing a North American ebook platform.  \nThey want to **acquire** it for $6K  \nMake it part of their ecosystem. Paid model. Big ad budget. Huge email list.\n\nIt‚Äôs flattering.  \nBut also weird.\n\nI never thought of this as a business.  \nBut now someone wants to turn it into one,  under their brand.  \nAnd $6K wont change my life, and maybe there's a bigger potential I dont see? But for one month of work sounds‚Ä¶ not bad?\n\nBut I keep thinking:  \nShould I hold it and grow it myself?  \nOr take the money, wish it well, and let it live a new life?\n\nCurious what you‚Äôd do if you were in my shoes.  \nThis was just a fun project. Now it‚Äôs maybe something more.  \nWhat‚Äôs the move?  If you have a plan and motivation to grow it then hold off. But otherwise you should negotiate for a higher price, something that will make you happy enough to not second guess later and truly move on. Good luck, it's a good problem to have as a builder, what you have! Tell them you are willing to sell if you keep 5% (or 10%) ownership Get copyright, trademark, intellectual property etc. otherwise the bigger firm will take it. \n\nMy suggestion is to get the offer to USD 20,000 and sell it.

I've often seen suggestions to add company logos to a landing page to show which businesses have used your app. But what if no company has actually used it yet? I'm guessing not to use these if no one has used it yet, right?\n\nI‚Äôve noticed that many landing pages include these logos right at the beginning, and it makes me wonder whether those companies truly use the app or not. Solid advice, I just re-did the landing page for [Eternal Vault](https://eternalvault.app). Although it's in beta and waitlist stage right now I'm hoping to hear that users are able to get a better understanding of the product from the improved landing page. Nice idea, \n\nthe pricing toggle button is confusing. If someone can give me this kind of format for highly convertible product page and cart üëãüëÄ Any advice for mobile page ?",

Answer common questions\n\n* Include a few FAQs to remove doubts\n* Focus on things people usually ask before signing up Like: Is it free to start? How long does setup take?\n\n# 7. End with a strong CTA\n\n* Repeat the offer and the download or signup buttons\n* Add another image if possible to keep things visual and easy to follow\n\nThis layout gives people all the right info step by step.  \nIt helps build trust and makes it easier for visitors to say yes.\n\nPS : I used this design for my¬†[SaaS](https://superwrapper.in/)¬†and got 3,000+ users\n\nIf your current landing page is not working well, try switching to this layout and test again.  I have a question. I've often seen suggestions to add company logos to a landing page to show which businesses have used your app. But what if no company has actually used it yet? I'm guessing not to use these if no one has used it yet, right?\n\nI‚Äôve noticed that many landing pages include these logos right at the beginning, and it makes me wonder whether those companies truly use the app or not. Solid advice, I just re-did the landing page for [Eternal Vault](https://eternalvault.app). Although it's in beta and waitlist stage right now I'm hoping to hear that users are able to get a better understanding of the product from the improved landing page. Nice idea, \n\nthe pricing toggle button is confusing. If someone can give me this kind of format for highly convertible product page and cart üëãüëÄ Any advice for mobile page ?",

No worries‚ÄîI made a cool project, I'm proud of myself, and I'll keep on fu\\*\\*\\* trying.\n\n**For those who don't know what 43Things was:** 43Things was basically this cool little place on the internet where people publicly shared their life goals. Simple, straightforward, and surprisingly motivating.\n\n**What I made**:   \n  \n43Check‚Äîkind of inspired by 43Things but with a twist. On 43Check, you publicly share your goals too, BUT, crucially, you also add one actionable task you'll do today to  move closer to that goal. And here's why I think this is a game changer: there's  no public task manager out there - I searched quite a few, I might be wrong though. Seeing others' tasks can spark ideas about how you can achieve your own goals. You like someone's task? You can add the same task and make it private or leave it public.\n\n**43Check is all about collaboration**‚Äîyou can team up on Goals and Tasks and share your progress openly with the community.\n\nYou can also, as you did on 43Things, Cheer on someone‚Äôs Goal or Task. But be careful‚Äîeach person only gets ONE cheer per day.\n\nPersonally, I built this to keep myself accountable, and my first goal on 43Check is straightforward: \"Get 43Check to 100 users.\" Honestly, could use some help!\n\nAs I already mentioned, I do this for fun; profits come later (if ever). I have a stable company that's serving me really well. So, it's completely FREE‚Äîanonymous users can add 6 goals and tasks per day, but registered users have no limits at all. Yeah, I know 43Things had a cap, but I decided not to bother with that.\n\nKnowing how Reddit rolls with ideas and feedback, I've also included a feature request section on 43Check. If you've got an idea, don‚Äôt hesitate‚Äîdrop it there!\n\nHere's the link, check it out if you're into setting goals and taking real action: [https://43check.com ](https://43check.com)\n\nLet me know your thoughts!  but why it's a picture of your screen instead of a screenshot? we need to get you a screen cleaner¬† btw you need more detailed examples there I filled something but It disappeared, I guess explore is not showing real-time. It goes to 404 if I press \"View Goal\"",

I thought it might be helpful to share how I made ‚Ç¨3,173 in the first 3 months after launching my macOS screen recording app, Screen Charm. It was built entirely solo while working a 9‚Äì5 job.\n\n\n\n# How it started\n\nOriginally, Screen Charm began as a Chrome extension, which I spent about four months building last year. I made some sales back then, but I wasn‚Äôt happy with the video quality - Chrome extensions just couldn‚Äôt match what I was aiming for. More importantly, I didn‚Äôt see a path to getting there.\n\nSo I made the hard call: refunded everyone (\\~30 users) and started rewriting it as a native macOS app. That rewrite took another three months (January to April this year). I used Electron, Next.js, and Remotion for video preview and rendering.\n\n\n\n# Pre-launch: free access for interviews\n\nBefore launching the paid version, I gave the app away for free in exchange for product interviews. I did about five Zoom calls where I asked users to try recording and exporting videos with the app. This helped me uncover bugs and usability issues early on.\n\nI spent about a month on these interviews and polishing the app based on feedback.\n\n\n\n# The launch\n\nIn April, I launched the paid version with a ‚Ç¨29.90 lifetime deal. I knew it was a strong offer compared to competitors, and people started buying - and more importantly, giving real feedback. Paying users give sharper insights because they care more about solving their problems.\n\nAfter selling the first 100 licenses, I increased the price to ‚Ç¨49.90.\n\n\n\n# Where users came from\n\nAlmost all traffic came from Twitter (X). No ads, no big launch - just consistent posts about my progress, failures, struggles, and ideas as a solo builder. A few tweets went viral. I even got retweeted by Pieter Levels a couple of times, which gave a nice boost. Those tweets brought big traffic spikes and a lot of my early customers.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nI know there are strong competitors out there. But my edge is simple:  \nI'm obsessed with video creation tools.  \nBefore Screen Charm, I was building a video editor - it didn‚Äôt work out, but I learned a ton.\n\nAfter 10 years of trying different ideas as a solo founder, this is the first one that‚Äôs really gained traction. I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve achieved and excited for what‚Äôs next.\n\n\n\n# My Advice to Solo Builders\n\nIf you‚Äôre building without funds, share everything on social media.  \nDon‚Äôt be afraid of other people‚Äôs opinions - **everyone faces similar struggles** on the journey.\n\nBe **transparent and honest** about your progress, your fears, and even your failures.  \nPeople can *feel* when you're being real - and they **love it**.\n\nI was honest 100% of the time, especially when things weren‚Äôt working.  \nThat openness built trust, sparked conversations, and attracted early users who genuinely cared.\n\n**Don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs perfect - build in the open.**\n\n\n\nIf you're building something similar or thinking of launching via X, feel free to ask anything - happy to share more!",

I realized if I could analyze this data, I could spot trends and find profitable niches before building anything.\n\nSo, I built a tool to do it.

First of all, let me say this: it‚Äôs great to see people taking initiative, solving problems, launching side-projects, and even making money along the way. That‚Äôs how innovation starts.\n\nBut this letter isn‚Äôt about applauding that. It‚Äôs about sending a **serious warning** to a growing group within this community.\n\n# You can‚Äôt \"vibe\" your way around user security.\n\nMany of you are building on tools like **Supabase**, using platforms like **Lovable** or **Bolt**, and pushing prompts to auto-generate full apps. That‚Äôs fine *for prototyping*. But the moment you share your product with the world, **you are taking on responsibility,** not just for your idea, but for **every user who trusts you with their data**.\n\nAnd what I‚Äôve seen lately is deeply alarming.\n\n* I‚Äôve come across vibe-coded platforms **with public Supabase endpoints exposing full user lists.**\n* I‚Äôve tested apps where I could **upgrade myself to premium**, **delete other users‚Äô data**, or **tamper with core records,** all because PUT or PATCH endpoints were wide open.\n* In one instance, I didn‚Äôt need any special tool or skill. Just a browser, inspect, and a few clicks.\n\nThis isn't \"hacking.\"  \nThis is **carelessness** disguised as innovation.\n\nLet me be clear:  \nIf your idea flops, that‚Äôs okay. If your side-project dies in beta, that‚Äôs okay.  \nBut if your users‚Äô data is leaked or manipulated because **you didn‚Äôt know or didn‚Äôt care enough to secure your backend**, that‚Äôs **NOT OKAY**. That‚Äôs negligence.\n\nAnd for non-technical founders:  \nIf you‚Äôre using no-code or AI tools to launch something without understanding the backend, **you must know the risks**. Just because it‚Äôs easy to deploy doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs safe.\n\n# If you don't know, learn. If you can‚Äôt fix it, don‚Äôt ship it.\n\nYou're not building toys anymore. You're building *trust*.\n\nThis post isn‚Äôt coming from a security expert. I‚Äôm a developer with 20+ years in web development. And I‚Äôm telling you, anyone can inspect network calls and tamper with your poorly configured APIs.\n\nSo here‚Äôs a simple ask:\n\n**Please take security seriously.**\n\nWhether it‚Äôs Supabase rules, authentication flows, or request validation, do your homework. Secure your endpoints. Ask the platform you're using for help. Don't gamble with user data just because you want to ride the \"launch fast\" trend.\n\nBuild fast, yes, but not blind.  \nBe creative, but be **responsible**.\n\nYour users don‚Äôt deserve spam or data leaks because someone wanted to ship a vibe-coded MVP in 1-2 days.\n\nSincerely,  \nA developer who still believes in quality, even at speed.\n\n**EDIT: Here are some tips that i follow and might help people reading:**\n\n1. Lockdown your backend (Supabase policies can help):\n\nMost vibe-coded apps using Supabase or Firebase leave their backend wide open. Anyone who knows your endpoint URL can potentially view or modify sensitive data, like user accounts, subscriptions, or even payment info.\n\n**What to do:** Don‚Äôt rely on default settings. Go into your Supabase project, open the **Auth Policies**, and restrict everything. By default, deny all access, and only allow specific users to access their own data.\n\n**Why:** Even if your frontend looks secure, if your backend allows anyone to hit the database directly, you‚Äôre not just vulnerable, you‚Äôre exposed.\n\nResource: [Supabase RLS Docs ](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security)\n\n2.  Don‚Äôt trust the frontend and always validate requests:  \nTools like Lovable or Bolt often generate frontend-heavy apps, where important actions (like account upgrades or profile edits) happen purely in the UI, with little to no checks behind the scenes.\n\n**What to do:** Always assume that **anyone** can inspect, modify, and resend requests. Validate every request on the backend: check if the user is logged in, if they have the right role, and if they‚Äôre even allowed to touch that data.\n\n**Why:** Frontend code can be faked, replayed, or manipulated. Without real backend validation, a malicious user can do far more than just \"test\" your app. They can break it.\n\n3. Never expose your secrets, keep keys truly private (Haven't seen it happening in case of Lovable at least):  \nAccidentally exposing env files is common, but keeping a tight file security if you're deploying it on your own server.\n\n4. You can ask your favourite AI vibe-coding tools to generate a security audit tasklist based on your project, and follow the tasklist and fix all until finished. That should solve most of the issues.\n\n**EDIT 2:**¬†After a lot of digging into many of them (got DMs too to test), I found that open REST endpoints are happening in Lovable mostly and not in Bolt. Bolt is setting up rules by default in Supabase, whereas Lovable isn't. Still keep a watch.\n\n**EDIT 3: Vulnerabilities like Client-side trust/Insecure Client-side enforcement:**\n\nI was able to get unlimited credits after changing the details of my profile within the browser, and when i make actions, the server doesn't confirm it. Here are some cases i have encountered:\n\nCase 1: In a linkedin lead extractor platform, I changed my limit from 0 to 1000 locally, and the website assumed I had that limit and instantly allowed me to use the export functionalit,y which was available in premium.\n\nCase 2: In an AI image restoration platform, I was able to use premium features by just altering the name of my package and available credits within the browser itself, and the website assumed I had that many credits and started allowing me premium features.\n\nSo, it could be harmful to you, too, if you're running an AI-based website where you provide credits to users. Anyone can burn up your credits in 1 night, and you could lose hundreds of dollars kept in your OpenAI/Claude/falai, etc account.\n\n**Note:** I've shared the same post in r/lovable as well, and people found it very useful, so shared it here too: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1lmkfhf/open\\_letter\\_to\\_all\\_vibecoders\\_especially\\_those/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1lmkfhf/open_letter_to_all_vibecoders_especially_those/)\n\nA user [u/goodtimesKC](https://www.reddit.com/user/goodtimesKC/) commented a good prompt that you can ask your favourite vibe-coding AI agent and it'll help you audit and set up security: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1lmkfhf/comment/n083sqr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1lmkfhf/comment/n083sqr/)\n\n**Edit 4:** This guide can also be followed: [https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security)",

So what I did was I basically analyzed over 150k negative reviews across 8000 companies on G2, and used AI to extract user problems and potential improvements to existing software, things that could turn into full-on competitors or lightweight plugins.\n\nI also scraped Reddit to find threads where people were complaining about tools, processes, or lack of features. On top of that, I pulled over 5000 job postings from Upwork to spot patterns in tasks people are hiring for that could be automated.\n\nFor G2, everything is organized by category and company, so you can drill down into the specific issues users have with a certain tool. For Reddit and Upwork, you can scan real user pain points and real paid problems across industries.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building or improving a SaaS, this database might save you a ton of guesswork and potentially give you the last product idea you will ever need.  So how are you actually making money?  \nDid you roll your scraper into a product and sold that, or have you built a product that was informed by the insights generated by the scraper?\n\nYour post is a bit vague. What is G2? Thanks for posting the same thing again üëç like you've done in 4 other subreddits How did you get the Reddit commercial api, or are you using the public one?",

Zero config needed, just start it up and go.\n\nI optimized it for usage while playing an instrument, so your phone might be laying in front of you, or you only have one hand free. So its very gesture driven, large tap targets, responsive feel. \n\nThe click is very precise and can run in the background. \n\nA couple of optional, hidden features:  \n\\- You can adjust the number of beats per bar  \n\\- Optional flash on every beat in two levels of brightness  \n\\- Accent the first beat  \n\\- Increase the tempo by X bpm every X bars \n\nThat's all I need ;) \n\nSo I'm building this for myself but it works really well and I'm thinking about releasing it ‚Äì either for free or a very small price.    \n  \nWhat do you think?  Love the UX. If you‚Äôd be able to add time signatures it would be an absolute game changer! Be careful experimenting. I heard about this one guy who fell asleep in a metronome factory and lost all sense of rhythm. drummer here - would have loved to have had this when i was first getting started. this is incredibly simple. please don't over complicated with feature bloat, and if you do - please do it with progressive disclosure design principles! DM'd you - awesome work beautiful UI Neat UI congrats!",

There are some website builders that give you a grid instead with their pre-defined way of element control meaning you are very limited by their design system. SEO is also solid out of the box, and you get to choose from so many different templates they have\n\n*Cons*\n\nThe pros are solid, but it‚Äôs too hard to use. I have experience using figma and also have had learned dev concepts so I can understand how to use webflow but it‚Äôs wayyyy to complex for a non-technical person to use it & feel like they have control.\n\n**Wix**\n\n*Pros*\n\nWix is great in a sense that they have huge widget market place, meaning you can find and drop widgets that you need to your website. I also think it is pretty easy to use compared to webflow, framer, etc. You also get built-in booking, events, and a again huge widget marketplace.\n\n*Cons*\n\nPages ship with heavy code, so Lighthouse scores need TLC. Templates are hard to swap mid-project, and the editor can feel cluttered.\n\n**Squarespace**\n\n*Pros*\n\nThe fastest path to a polished blog or portfolio. Good templates plus solid ecommerce checkout experience. If you are building an ecommerce site, I highly recommend Squarespace. Fluid Engine lets you drag elements almost anywhere.\n\n*Cons*\n\nAt some point though, it became soo annoying for me to tweak mobile views. While they make it easy, the downside is that you sometimes lose control and the responsiveness (i.e. desktop view, mobile view etc) becomes too hard to control. When you adjust for desktop view, mobile view becomes weird, vice versa.\n\n**Framer**\n\n*Pros*\n\nFramer feels almost exactly like working in Figma: auto-layout, custom breakpoints, and responsive tweaks are second nature. Publishing is pretty fast bc they are using their edge network, and the built-in CMS lets you bind collection lists pretty easily.\n\n*Cons*\n\nThe power comes obviously comes at the price of simplicity.. the learning curve is steep if you‚Äôre not already comfortable with design tools - similar pattern with webflow. You‚Äôll still need third-party embeds for basic database or form logic, the blog feature set is early-stage (no native author pages or tags yet).\n\n**Carrd**\n\n*Pros*\n\nCarrd is very easy to use. Good for portfolios etc, but again you‚Äôll see the pattern here.\n\n*Cons*\n\nYou‚Äôre limited to a single page, which hurts SEO depth, design controls are minimal (no real grid or component system).\n\n**Patterns I noticed**\n\n***In general, if a website builder is easy to use, it‚Äôs limiting, and if it‚Äôs robust and flexible, it‚Äôs hard to use.*** That comes down to each tool‚Äôs design system. An ‚Äúeasy‚Äù design system relies on guardrails, which inevitably restrict what you can do; a more open-ended system removes those guardrails, but the trade-off is a steeper learning curve. This is why I just decided to code my websites instead of using the builders.\n\nI realized this years ago, and for this reason, I decided to build my own website builder using AI to make it super easy for ppl to build, edit, and maintain a site. Even the simplest website builders have learning curve and I wanted to remove the barrier.\n\nWe built and launched [alpha.page](http://alpha.page) with some of my friends who are experienced with website building.

I have experience using figma and also have had learned dev concepts so I can understand how to use webflow but it‚Äôs wayyyy to complex for a non-technical person to use it & feel like they have control.\n\n**Wix**\n\n*Pros*\n\nWix is great in a sense that they have huge widget market place, meaning you can find and drop widgets that you need to your website. I also think it is pretty easy to use compared to webflow, framer, etc. You also get built-in booking, events, and a again huge widget marketplace.\n\n*Cons*\n\nPages ship with heavy code, so Lighthouse scores need TLC. Templates are hard to swap mid-project, and the editor can feel cluttered.\n\n**Squarespace**\n\n*Pros*\n\nThe fastest path to a polished blog or portfolio. Good templates plus solid ecommerce checkout experience. If you are building an ecommerce site, I highly recommend Squarespace. Fluid Engine lets you drag elements almost anywhere.\n\n*Cons*\n\nAt some point though, it became soo annoying for me to tweak mobile views. While they make it easy, the downside is that you sometimes lose control and the responsiveness (i.e. desktop view, mobile view etc) becomes too hard to control. When you adjust for desktop view, mobile view becomes weird, vice versa.\n\n**Framer**\n\n*Pros*\n\nFramer feels almost exactly like working in Figma: auto-layout, custom breakpoints, and responsive tweaks are second nature. Publishing is pretty fast bc they are using their edge network, and the built-in CMS lets you bind collection lists pretty easily.\n\n*Cons*\n\nThe power comes obviously comes at the price of simplicity.. the learning curve is steep if you‚Äôre not already comfortable with design tools - similar pattern with webflow. You‚Äôll still need third-party embeds for basic database or form logic, the blog feature set is early-stage (no native author pages or tags yet).\n\n**Carrd**\n\n*Pros*\n\nCarrd is very easy to use. Good for portfolios etc, but again you‚Äôll see the pattern here.\n\n*Cons*\n\nYou‚Äôre limited to a single page, which hurts SEO depth, design controls are minimal (no real grid or component system).\n\n**Patterns I noticed**\n\n***In general, if a website builder is easy to use, it‚Äôs limiting, and if it‚Äôs robust and flexible, it‚Äôs hard to use.*** That comes down to each tool‚Äôs design system. An ‚Äúeasy‚Äù design system relies on guardrails, which inevitably restrict what you can do; a more open-ended system removes those guardrails, but the trade-off is a steeper learning curve. This is why I just decided to code my websites instead of using the builders.\n\nI realized this years ago, and for this reason, I decided to build my own website builder using AI to make it super easy for ppl to build, edit, and maintain a site. Even the simplest website builders have learning curve and I wanted to remove the barrier.\n\nWe built and launched [alpha.page](http://alpha.page) with some of my friends who are experienced with website building. So far we were lucky to get some awesome users who find alpha unbelievably easy and pleasant to use. If you are building a website, hopefully give alpha a shot and give us some feedbacks!  Used Carrd before definitely easy but I agree that SEO sucks with it so I switched to Durable after seeing it recommended here.\n\n\nJust as easy to use but I got a live site + CRM + invoicing in under a minute and I‚Äôm actually ranking for my service keywords now. Have you tried Wordpress? I spent $600 to a freelancer to edit a template on framer and handling responsiveness was very annoying so I definitely agree with you that traditional website builders weren't easy at all for someone like me to use Webstudio is another good one. It‚Äôs an open source competitor to Webflow and Framer.\n\nhttps://webstudio.is/ Duuude, registration right after the promt? Ok, you'll have my 10 minutes mail, but no result after registration?! You want me to create a company first? Thanks but no. how about done for you solutions with ongoing maintenance starting from $40/month, for the 10 first customers at least, [buildquick.io](http://buildquick.io)",

Some grew, some sold, some I‚Äôm still working on.\n\nHere‚Äôs the quick rundown:\n\nLectureKit\n\n* Time to build: \\~1 year total (spread out, \\~120 hours)\n* Result: 190 users, 0 paying customers\n* I left it alone for about a year, then got a few acquisition offers and sold it for¬†$6,750\n\nNextUpKit\n\n* Time to build: \\~1 week (but spread over 6 months lol)\n* Very simple Next.js starter kit\n* Made \\~$300 total (I don't market it, but I randomly get a sale here and there)\n\nWaitListKit\n\n* Discontinued (did get 1 pre sale payment though, I refunded cause I didn't want to work on it)\n\nCaptureKit\n\n* Time to build MVP: \\~3 weeks\n* In \\~2 months: 300+ users, 7 paying customers, $127 MRR (not $127K, just $127 üòÖ)\n* Sold it for¬†$15,000\n* Took 2.5 months from building to sale.\n\nAnd now I‚Äôm working on my next project: SocialKit.\n\nI‚Äôm trying to take everything I learned from the previous ones (especially CaptureKit) and apply it here from day 0.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing and planning:\n\n\\-¬†SEO from day 0¬†- I built a content plan with \\~20 post ideas, posting a new blog every 2‚Äì5 days.  \n\\-¬†Marketing pages¬†- Dedicated pages for each sub-category of the SaaS.  \n\\-¬†Free tools¬†- Built and launched a few already to provide value and get traffic:\n\n* Internal linking + link building- Listing the site on various directories, even paying \\~$120 for someone to help because it‚Äôs time-consuming.\n* User feedback¬†- Giving early users free usage in exchange for honest feedback, and I even ask for a review for social proof.\n* Content cross-sharing¬†- Blog ‚Üí¬†Dev to¬†‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Reddit ‚Üí LinkedIn ‚Üí YouTube.\n\nStuff I plan to keep doing:\n\n* Keep posting 1‚Äì2 blogs a week (targeting niche keywords).\n* Keep building more free tools.\n* Share progress publicly on Reddit and LinkedIn (fun fact: one of the buyers for CaptureKit first reached out on LinkedIn).\n* YouTube tutorials and how-tos for no-code/automation users (Make, n8n, Zapier, etc.).\n* Listings on sites like RapidAPI.\n* Avoiding X/Twitter (just doesn't work for me).\n\nHonestly, the strategy is pretty simple:¬†building while marketing.  \nNot waiting to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù before I start promoting.\n\nTrying stuff many solo devs ignore, like:\n\n* Building in public\n* Sharing real numbers\n* Free tools to bring traffic\n* YouTube (even though it feels awkward at first)\n\nAnyway, that's the plan so far for SocialKit.  \nHoping sharing this helps someone.\n\nIf you're doing something similar, I'd love to hear how you‚Äôre approaching it.\n\nHappy to answer any questions :)  Where did you find someone willing to pay $6,750 for something that has 0 revenue? What is CaptureKit? Thank you for sharing your journey. Building in public  is an great approach and extremely difficult to do.",

AMA I recently open sourced my project, [FjordKit.com](https://www.fjordkit.com/en/?utm_source=reddit&utm_content=firsteuro).\n\nI‚Äôm super happy, so I wanted to share this small win.\n\nThe project is a Notion-based ‚ÄòStyle Consistency Toolkit‚Äô, designed to get more predictable image generation output from LLM‚Äôs, through Style Recipes.\n\nStyle Recipes are simply instruction sets, that utilize meta-prompting, and instructs the model to output images in a consistent style.\n\nThis allows the user to use natural language to describe exactly what they want. Especially powerful in combination with a reference image.\n\nNext steps for me is building a community around the project, drop new Style Recipes, and nurture my users (130 users already signed up!)\n\nAsk me anything. I learned a lot over the past month, and I‚Äôm happy to share.\n  How are you going to spend your new riches? Living the life Congrats! Shavings make a pile! \n\nHappy to help if things get more complex when it comes to pricing :) Why the move to open-source?",

I don't think making the thing free will make people buy, I don't think lowering nor raising the price will do the thing\n\nyou need to convey the (immense) value that people get from your site and compare it with (ridiculously low in comparison) price of $20/mo. this means:  \n  \n1. FOMO works great for you, I wouldn't recommend making a free trial here. Instead, charge the users your price, but add a lot of things like 30-day no-questions-asked money back guarantee, plenty of reviews with genuine real users, add a big testimonial as one of the sections that describes how someone got a promotion/their dream job because they learnt a skill thanks to you. build rapport, but don't make your content free to access by anyone. if someone is serious about learning, $20 is nothing for them (quality 1hr coaching session starts from $50/hr, growthmentor is insane value and charges only $50-$75/mo)  \n  \n2. pack more value, keep the price or increase it, but give people more value - If they want to learn random hobby like a \"guitar\", then figure out how to make learning it, the before step or the after step easier. before they learn the guitar, they probably need to own one. how do they choose the right one for beginners? after they learn the guitar, how do they maintain their skills? what are the best hacks to speedrun this learning process? what can they do once they learn the basics? can they connect with others? do they want to connect with others? and it's just a simple guitar example. it is easier with skills directly tied to making money\n\n3. get rid of any extra features that do not directly give people value. you have a couple of users - talk to them, ask why they decided to pay, what were they expecting. don't look for compliments, look for the truth about reality and the market. if most of them continue to use the app after a month, that means you're solving the real problem that people are willing to pay for. laser focus on solving this one specific problem to the best of your ability and reduce anything that creates friction/takes away their focus from achieving value from your product.\n\n4. share free, high quality learning resources to also boost your reputation. you can do it by blogging, creating a lead magnet, analysing something, writing a longer tweet or whatever. the most important thing is it has to be top top quality. if you do it well, people will start sharing your resource and you'll go viral\n\nhope this helps, again, love the design and the angle you took with the product, wishing you the best of luck UI really cool!! which library did u used?

Here‚Äôs my brutally honest journey Building a SaaS is easy.  \nGetting people to actually care is the hard part. Here‚Äôs what happened.\n\nIn late June, I started building a tool called [Text Behind Object ](https://www.textbehindobject.xyz) it helps creators make thumbnails with text placed *behind* the subject in an image. I thought it was a unique, useful idea.\n\nBut things broke fast.\n\nI couldn't deploy it on Vercel due to build errors. I asked Cursor AI to help fix it, but the errors only got worse.\n\nSo I deleted the entire project and started from scratch.\n\nAfter two days, I rebuilt the first version using **Bolt AI** and successfully deployed it. Then I started using Cursor to make continuous improvements.\n\nI launched with a free version for the first 10 days. No traction. No one seemed to care.\n\nThen I integrated **DodoPayments**, added a paid version, and started posting on Reddit and Twitter.\n\nThat changed everything.\n\nMost of the traffic started coming from the US and Canada.\n\nFirst week: 2 sales  \nNext week: 1 sale  \nThen 2 more  \nBut this week?

That question about 'what annoys you' really hit, and great job overcoming paralysis and building the demo. PlotTwisted looks really cool. It could be awesome to have some initial suggestions populated - maybe trending movies - for everyone to choose as candidates! Brilliant idea That's a wonderful way to find a project you really care about.\nI have some thoughts on getting good feedback if you're ever curious.",

Always have.\n\nSo I asked ChatGPT:\n\n**‚ÄúCan you interview me (step by step) to help me come up with a niche saas project idea?‚Äù**\n\nIt asked:\n\n* ‚ÄúWhat problems do your friends/family ask you to help with?‚Äù\n* ‚ÄúWhat do you find annoying but no one has solved?‚Äù\n* ‚ÄúWhere do you spend your time online?\"\n\nOne answer I gave was how chaotic movie nights are with my 3 sisters We always fight over what to watch, rank stuff manually in the Notes app or on paper, or spend more time deciding than actually watching anything. üíÄ\n\nI didn't think about automating that process until gpt asked me that second question above. (‚Äú**What do you find annoying but no one has solved?‚Äù**) .\n\nIt's such a simple question but during the interview you really get in a zone and the creative brain juices will start flowing.\n\n(I actually came up with a second idea too, it‚Äôs something that already exists, but I could niche it down for a specific audience. It's a bit of a sensitive provlem tho)\n\nBut yeah, after that I started building a little web app. I ended up calling it PlotTwisted (still pre-launch). What‚Äôs wild is it‚Äôs the first time in years I‚Äôve felt that ‚Äúo mg I‚Äôm actually making something‚Äù feeling again. During my very short competitor analysis/ research I couldn't find a similar group movie picker app, but even if the idea isn't unique, it's something I'm passioante about and will finish to create.\n\nI‚Äôve been using¬†**Cursor**¬†and¬†**Canva**¬†to prototype stuff, and honestly, they helped me get over the mental block of ‚Äúthis is too much.‚Äù Cursor especially made it feel doable , the setup, layout, animations, all way easier than I expected.\n\nI‚Äôm still tweaking the app, but just the act of building something based on¬†*my own life*¬†has been the most fun part. (If anyone‚Äôs curious about the app or wants to help and beta test when it‚Äôs ready, I set up a¬†[**waitlist here,**](https://waitlist.plottwisted.watch/)¬†no pressure at all üíå)\n\nDefinitely recommend letting ChatGPT ‚Äúinterview‚Äù you!! I swear it unlocks a part of your brain that‚Äôs been waiting to build stuff.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* I used ChatGPT to ‚Äúinterview‚Äù me step by step ‚Üí it asked what problems I deal with, what friends ask me for help with, and what annoys me that no one has solved.\n* That unlocked a surprisingly good idea from my everyday life\n* Realized I don‚Äôt need the¬†*perfect*¬†idea, just a problem I care about.\n* Tools like Cursor (for setup/layout/animations) + Canva helped me¬†*actually start*¬†instead of procrastinating.  It's such a cool idea, and the demo was really nice! I think it would be even cooler with a Randomizer button to spit out 5 or so movies! There have been times where I have had to pick between what to watch, but the same amount of time to even think of anything to watch. \nOverall, this is such a cool and unique way of building something you're passionate about, I hope all goes well! :) A nice little idea definitely something I could see people repeat using if movie nights are a tradition Love this! That question about 'what annoys you' really hit, and great job overcoming paralysis and building the demo. PlotTwisted looks really cool. It could be awesome to have some initial suggestions populated - maybe trending movies - for everyone to choose as candidates! Brilliant idea That's a wonderful way to find a project you really care about.\nI have some thoughts on getting good feedback if you're ever curious.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\nI just came out the backend of the toughest year of my life. For context I have a masters in computer science and a pretty decent portfolio but 0 years of professional work experience as a dev (1 month freelance). \n\nOver the course of 6 months I submitted well over 1000 applications and this was a full time job. In this full time job, I would open my email each morning to a wave of automated rejection emails telling me they had decided to go with other candidates. I'm convinced 95% of my applications were never even looked at by human eyes. \n\nLets be honest the application process is completely broken (especially for junior devs). Everyone is using AI to write CVs and cover letters and those who don't, can't keep up the number of applications required to compete in the market or already have enough experience to attract interviews. Its nice to think that if you write it from start to finish with no AI that you will get kudos from the hiring team but in reality it will likely make no difference other than slowing you down.\n\nSo If you don't have the experience then how do you compete with the hundreds of applicants who do? Do you spend hours on your portfolio? Do you cold email the CTO of all the companies you apply to? Well both of these are great if you have something to stand out on your portfolio or email but a simple portfolio blog app probably wont impress in the current market. \n\nIf there is one piece of advice that changed everything in just a few days its:\n\n**Build a product. Not a project.**\n\nBy this I mean build something end to end and then release it, post it on reddit, get criticised and then build some more and improve it based on the feedback. Obsess over it like a real founder. It's important that you really treat this as a product designed to succeed and not just for your CV. In my case I built [Chunk](https://www.chunkapp.net) which I launched on product hunt with only 10 upvotes. I kept at it and listened to all user feedback and even the brutal stuff and just kept building to improve it. Once there was significant changes Product Hunt allowed a relaunch and with no paid marketing or \"hunters\" I got to #3 product of the day competing with dev teams of 10+ people. So go build your product.\n\nBy doing this, If you don't have work experience then you're making your own. Startups will leap to interview you if you have just one product on your CV that you independently launched (Launch somewhere like ProductHunt), spoke directly with users, iterated on that feedback, created a roadmap. \n\nDoing this has 2 main effects:\n\n\\- You will get interviews! Stick it loud and clear on your CV that you created an app with real users. \n\n\\- It will massively increase your confidence in interviews. When the question comes up to talk about a recent project you're proud of you will have so much more to talk about than the classic CV project with no users that you haven't touched for weeks or months. \n\nNow this might not land you a job in a huge firm like capgemini or accenture but startups will love it. I had no luck for 8 months then after doing this and updating my CV and applications literally everything changed. \n\nIf you have a product you're working on feel free to comment it below and i'd love to check it out and show some support. \n\n**Build a product. Not a project.**",

In this full time job, I would open my email each morning to a wave of automated rejection emails telling me they had decided to go with other candidates. I'm convinced 95% of my applications were never even looked at by human eyes. \n\nLets be honest the application process is completely broken (especially for junior devs). Everyone is using AI to write CVs and cover letters and those who don't, can't keep up the number of applications required to compete in the market or already have enough experience to attract interviews. Its nice to think that if you write it from start to finish with no AI that you will get kudos from the hiring team but in reality it will likely make no difference other than slowing you down.\n\nSo If you don't have the experience then how do you compete with the hundreds of applicants who do? Do you spend hours on your portfolio? Do you cold email the CTO of all the companies you apply to? Well both of these are great if you have something to stand out on your portfolio or email but a simple portfolio blog app probably wont impress in the current market. \n\nIf there is one piece of advice that changed everything in just a few days its:\n\n**Build a product. Not a project.**\n\nBy this I mean build something end to end and then release it, post it on reddit, get criticised and then build some more and improve it based on the feedback. Obsess over it like a real founder. It's important that you really treat this as a product designed to succeed and not just for your CV. In my case I built [Chunk](https://www.chunkapp.net) which I launched on product hunt with only 10 upvotes. I kept at it and listened to all user feedback and even the brutal stuff and just kept building to improve it. Once there was significant changes Product Hunt allowed a relaunch and with no paid marketing or \"hunters\" I got to #3 product of the day competing with dev teams of 10+ people. So go build your product.\n\nBy doing this, If you don't have work experience then you're making your own. Startups will leap to interview you if you have just one product on your CV that you independently launched (Launch somewhere like ProductHunt), spoke directly with users, iterated on that feedback, created a roadmap. \n\nDoing this has 2 main effects:\n\n\\- You will get interviews! Stick it loud and clear on your CV that you created an app with real users. \n\n\\- It will massively increase your confidence in interviews. When the question comes up to talk about a recent project you're proud of you will have so much more to talk about than the classic CV project with no users that you haven't touched for weeks or months. \n\nNow this might not land you a job in a huge firm like capgemini or accenture but startups will love it. I had no luck for 8 months then after doing this and updating my CV and applications literally everything changed. \n\nIf you have a product you're working on feel free to comment it below and i'd love to check it out and show some support. \n\n**Build a product. Not a project.**",

Last year I had this idea for a post-op recovery app. Patients could track milestones, manage meds, communicate with doctors, family could help coordinate care. Really solid problem to solve and I was pumped to build it.\n\nStarted coding and immediately fell into the infrastructure trap. Instead of building the actual recovery features, I spent literally 6 months trying to build HIPAA-compliant auth from scratch, setting up secure databases, building video call systems, basically becoming a security expert when I just wanted to help patients recover better. Burned out completely. Didn't touch the project for months because I was so deep in the weeds on stuff that had nothing to do with why I started this thing.\n\nFinally had this lightbulb moment: my app's value isn't the login screen, it's the recovery workflows and care coordination. Why the hell was I building authentication when there are already HIPAA-compliant solutions out there? Completely changed approach. Found pre-built components for auth, scheduling, e-prescribing, messaging. Plugged them together like legos. Had a working MVP in 3 weeks that I could actually put in front of real patients.\n\nNow I'm getting testimonials from families saying this is helping their recovery instead of debugging OAuth flows at 2am. The lesson that's obvious in hindsight: don't build infrastructure, build your unique value. Everything else can probably be bought or integrated.\n\nAnyone else fall into this trap? How do you decide what to build vs buy, especially when you're bootstrapping and every dollar counts? For those in healthcare, what shortcuts did you find for compliance stuff that actually work?

      "comments_text": "I would change the ‚Äúwill be popular‚Äù to ‚Äúpopular‚Äù in the pricing boxes. Sounds more professional and confident, like the product is actually already used by someone. Hey, first of all, major props to you. \n\nWhat you've built looks polished, and it's clear there's a lot of thought behind how things are wired together. The integration between RAG, OpenAI chat, and Telegram in one visual node-based interface is a solid achievement.\n\nThat said, I want to share a perspective that might challenge the assumption that tools like n8n, Langflow, or Flowise are \"primitive\" or not meant for non-technical users.\n\nWe recently built a sequence builder for a healthcare robotics client-primarily used by nurses. These are highly skilled professionals, but not technical in the sense of understanding data flow, I/O bindings, or conditional routing in UIs with multiple connection points.\n\nWe intentionally chose a serial, step-by-step builder using the Flow-Builder library by ByteDance (https://github.com/bytedance/flow-builder).   \n  \nWhy? Because linear sequences just make more sense to non-technical users. There's a start, a middle, and an end. No crisscrossing wires, no ambiguity around what goes where. It‚Äôs just: \"This happens, then that happens.\"\n\nIn contrast, your system looks to be built on something like ReactFlow (https://reactflow.dev/), which is super robust. I‚Äôve used it too. But for non-tech folks, nodes with 5 connection points and no clear linearity can be overwhelming fast. It feels more like wiring a microcontroller than building a workflow. Most users get lost figuring out what goes into what and where something even starts.\n\nAlso worth noting-tools like n8n may need 10 nodes to do what your system does in 1, but that's not a bug or primitiveway, it‚Äôs a feature. That granularity gives power, visibility, and extreme flexibility. \n\nYou want to conditionally fetch an API and parse just a part of the result? You can. \n\nYou want to use a different LLM just for a sub-task? Sure. \n\nYou want to visualize exactly where something broke? Easy. \n\nAnd you‚Äôre not vendor-locked into someone‚Äôs interpretation of what a node should do.\n\nAnd honestly, your system doesn‚Äôt feel like it's made for non-technical users either. Just consider:\n\n\\- How do they know where the query in OpenAI comes from?\n\n\\- What do they do when there are multiple outputs? Where does the data flow?\n\n\\- Can they branch a Telegram response easily?\n\n\\- What happens when you want two different models based on a switch?\n\nYour UI is super cool for devs and prompt engineers. But for someone who wants to visually automate without technical friction, tools like n8n work because they‚Äôre clear and sequential by design.\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm not here to knock your tool, there‚Äôs room for all types of builders. I really appreciate you noting down all the feedback and incorporating it before launch. kudos to your entire team and their efforts.

      "full_text_content": "We made a visual, node-based builder that empowers you to create powerful AI agents for any task, without writing a single line of code. For months, this is what we've been building.¬†\n\nCountless late nights, endless feedback loops, and a relentless focus on making AI accessible to everyone. I'm incredibly proud of what the team has built.¬†\n\nIf you've ever wanted to build a powerful AI agent but were blocked by code, this is for you. Join our closed beta and let's build together.¬†\n\n[https://deforge.io/](https://deforge.io/)  I would change the ‚Äúwill be popular‚Äù to ‚Äúpopular‚Äù in the pricing boxes. Sounds more professional and confident, like the product is actually already used by someone. Hey, first of all, major props to you. \n\nWhat you've built looks polished, and it's clear there's a lot of thought behind how things are wired together. The integration between RAG, OpenAI chat, and Telegram in one visual node-based interface is a solid achievement.\n\nThat said, I want to share a perspective that might challenge the assumption that tools like n8n, Langflow, or Flowise are \"primitive\" or not meant for non-technical users.\n\nWe recently built a sequence builder for a healthcare robotics client-primarily used by nurses. These are highly skilled professionals, but not technical in the sense of understanding data flow, I/O bindings, or conditional routing in UIs with multiple connection points.\n\nWe intentionally chose a serial, step-by-step builder using the Flow-Builder library by ByteDance (https://github.com/bytedance/flow-builder).   \n  \nWhy? Because linear sequences just make more sense to non-technical users. There's a start, a middle, and an end. No crisscrossing wires, no ambiguity around what goes where. It‚Äôs just: \"This happens, then that happens.\"\n\nIn contrast, your system looks to be built on something like ReactFlow (https://reactflow.dev/), which is super robust. I‚Äôve used it too. But for non-tech folks, nodes with 5 connection points and no clear linearity can be overwhelming fast. It feels more like wiring a microcontroller than building a workflow. Most users get lost figuring out what goes into what and where something even starts.\n\nAlso worth noting-tools like n8n may need 10 nodes to do what your system does in 1, but that's not a bug or primitiveway, it‚Äôs a feature. That granularity gives power, visibility, and extreme flexibility. \n\nYou want to conditionally fetch an API and parse just a part of the result? You can. \n\nYou want to use a different LLM just for a sub-task? Sure. \n\nYou want to visualize exactly where something broke? Easy. \n\nAnd you‚Äôre not vendor-locked into someone‚Äôs interpretation of what a node should do.\n\nAnd honestly, your system doesn‚Äôt feel like it's made for non-technical users either. Just consider:\n\n\\- How do they know where the query in OpenAI comes from?\n\n\\- What do they do when there are multiple outputs? Where does the data flow?\n\n\\- Can they branch a Telegram response easily?\n\n\\- What happens when you want two different models based on a switch?\n\nYour UI is super cool for devs and prompt engineers. But for someone who wants to visually automate without technical friction, tools like n8n work because they‚Äôre clear and sequential by design.\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm not here to knock your tool, there‚Äôs room for all types of builders. I really appreciate you noting down all the feedback and incorporating it before launch. kudos to your entire team and their efforts. But just wanted to push back a bit on calling everything else \"primitive\" when sometimes, simplicity is the smartest tech.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8e114v0ubobf1.gif What makes your tool different from others like n8n?\n\nI understand that you‚Äôre using this approach to test the market, but you still need a clear USP (Unique Selling Proposition).

We ended the day with around 400 people on our waitlist and as of last week we‚Äôve shipped the first real ‚ÄúHups‚Äù to paying customers. The first few came online today.\n\nWe went ‚Äúviral‚Äù on a few different sub-reddits that day. I‚Äôll share those posts below to you can copy the strategy if you want. \n\nIn between all of that, I was able to raise some capital and join a startup portfolio here in SF. My first employee started this past Wednesday.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who commented, provided feedback and showed interest. I‚Äôm sure you all can resonate with how validating that type of early interaction feels.\n\nHere‚Äôs the posts we made, including my original one here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/s/fe1eZkpfjG\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/s/IGPl8y7ynN\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/s/eQXY51OhUY  Congrats I'm super happy for you and that was a cool story to follow. I'm inspired thanks for sharing the journey and all the best of luck to you! Good luck!\nThanks for this video. It‚Äôs motivating) Dude this is awesome! Congrats!!! I didn't see your earlier post, but WOW, what a huge step in the journey! Hey dude this is fricking awesome!! \n\nI'd love to know more about it/how I can get one? Specifically I have some questions around how it works!\n\nBut even if I can't get in on this, it looks awesome and it's so cool to see someone making something to help them and being rewarded for sharing that with others üíú so sick. hope we get to see more.",

I posted on r/SideProject and a couple of frugal/tech subs. I was transparent. just said I built something and wanted feedback. No hype, no spam. I shared how it works, added a quick demo, and stuck around to answer every comment.\n\n**Twitter** helped too. I had no followers, but I tweeted my progress using #buildinpublic and replied to a few people who were actually looking for price comparisons. I also joined two Twitter Spaces and briefly shared what I made surprisingly got a bunch of installs from that.\n\nNo ads. No hacks. Just being honest, helpful, and responsive. Let me know if you have any questions!  This looks super nice and easy to use. here's the link btw [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/price-comparison-find-low/nikhaokjeplnpmiacenkhmbfoeondkga](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/price-comparison-find-low/nikhaokjeplnpmiacenkhmbfoeondkga) Looks nice üëç.

Bjj is rising, and I believe it has a huge potential in that niche! How did you build map, what program did you use? Very cool, I‚Äôd love to see this as a state machine. What tech stack did you use? This is pretty cool",

Received info for flights I had already looked up, but confirmed my 6 or so choices of departure cities were in the economical running. \nI‚Äôm going to assume I can add a perimeter of under so many hours as well?

So I shifted to reaching out to people one-on-one who I *thought* might actually find value in it.\n\nThat worked better. That‚Äôs how I got my first user. But I know that‚Äôs not sustainable. I can‚Äôt cold-message people all day for the next 6 months.\n\nSo I‚Äôm stuck right now wondering, How do I take this to the next level?How do I get people to *find me*, instead of me having to find everyone? Is it SEO? Content? Paid ads? Something else?\n\nI‚Äôm not trying to turn this into a million-dollar company. I just want to earn enough to pay for my **master‚Äôs tuition** without taking a loan or asking my parents. After that, I plan to open-source the whole thing so others can use and build on it freely.  \nSo if anyone here has gone through something similar, or has advice on how to get from ‚Äúfirst few users‚Äù to ‚Äúsmall, sustainable traction,‚Äù I would love to learn from you.\n\nP.S. The product which im talking about it [reviewsandfeedback](https://reviewsandfeedback.info/) it basically gives u a widget script which u can add it to your website, webapp or landing page and your user's can submit feedback, reviews, bug reports, feature requests directly through your webapp and you can manage all of them from a dashboard without going back and forth in dm's or email threads. it's free to use with paid versions available.\n\nI know this was long. I just needed to get it out there. To share the journey. To connect with folks who know how tough this path is. If you read this far thank you.\n\nWould love any feedback, tips, or even just a few kind words. It‚Äôs tough out here, but small wins like these keep me going.",

My goal is to use it to showcase projects I‚Äôll be working on over time, and hopefully have something I can share with recruiters or startup founders down the line.\n\nThe design was inspired by the Mac desktop UI; I wanted to create a playful, desktop-like experience in the browser. That‚Äôs why the site is desktop-only for now.
